Subject: [PATCH 11/74] build: introduce security hardening flags in gluster

This patch introduces two of the security hardening compiler flags RELRO & PIE
in gluster codebase. Using _hardened_build as 1 doesn't guarantee the existance
of these flags in the compilation as different versions of RHEL have different
redhat-rpm-config macro. So the idea is to export these flags at spec file
level.

Label: DOWNSTREAM ONLY
