    storage/posix: Log when mkdir is on an existing gfid but non-existent
    path.
    
    consider following steps on a distribute volume
    
    1. rename (src, dst) on hashed subvolume
    2. snapshot taken
    3. restore snapshots and do stat on src and dst
    
    Now, we end up with two directories src and dst having same gfid,
    because of distribute creating directories on non-existent subvolumes
    as part of directory healing.
    
    This can happen even with race between rename and directory healing in
    dht-lookup. This can lead to undefined behaviour while accessing any
    of both directories. Hence, we are logging paths of both
    directories, so that a sysadmin can take some corrective action when
    (s)he sees this log. One of the corrective action can be to copy
    contents of both directories from backend into a new directory and
    delete both directories.
    
    Since effort involved to fix this issue is non-trivial, giving this
    workaround till we come up with a fix.

    cluster/afr: Handle EAGAIN properly in inodelk
    
    Problem:
    When one of the brick is taken down and brough back up in a replica pair, locks
    on that brick will be allowed. Afr returns inodelk success even when one of the
    bricks already has the lock taken.
    
    Fix:
    If any brick returns EAGAIN return failure to parent xlator.

    features/quota: fixes to dentry management code in rename.
    
    1. After a successful rename (src, dst), the dentry
     <dst-parent, dst-basename> would be associated with src-inode.
    
    2. Its src inode that survives if both of src and dst are present.
    
    The fixes are done based on the above two observation.

    cluster/dht: fix memory corruption in locking api.
    
    <man 3 qsort>
    
    The  contents  of the array are sorted in ascending order
    according to a comparison function pointed to by compar, which is
    called with two arguments that "point to the objects being
    compared".
    
    </man 3 qsort>
    
    qsort passes "pointers to members of the array" to comparision
    function. Since the members of the array happen to be (dht_lock_t *),
    the arguments passed to dht_lock_request_cmp are of type (dht_lock_t
    **). Previously we assumed them to be of type (dht_lock_t *), which
    resulted in memory corruption.

    cluster/dht: Fixed double UNWIND in lookup everywhere code
    
    In dht_lookup_everywhere_done:
    Line: 1194 we call DHT_STACK_UNWIND
    and in the same if condition we go ahead and call, goto
    unwind_hashed_and_cached; which at Line 1371 calls another UNWIND.
    As is obvious, higher frames could cleanup their locals and on
    receiving the next unwind could cause a coredump of the process.
    Fixed the same by calling the required return post the first unwind.

    glusterd: Prevent rebalance starting with old clients
    
    Glusterd will prevent rebalance from starting when clients older than
    RHS-2.1u5 are connected to a volume. This is needed as running
    rebalance with old clients connected could lead to data loss in some
    cases. The DHT xlator on newer clients (>= RHS-2.1u5) has been fixed to
    prevent the data loss issues.
    
    NOTE: The DHT fixes are yet to be backported to RHS-2.1. But once
    backported they should be available from RHS-2.1u5. Hence, we are
    checking for clients of RHS-2.1u5 and above.

    storage/posix: Prefer gfid links for inode-handle
    
            Backport of http://review.gluster.org/8575
    
    Problem:
    File path could change by other entry operations in-flight so if renames are in
    progress at the time of other operations like open, it may lead to failures.
    We observed that this issue can also happen while renames and readdirps/lookups
    are in progress because dentry-table is going stale sometimes.
    
    Fix:
    Prefer gfid-handles over paths for files. For directory handles prefering
    gfid-handles hits performance issues because it needs to resolve paths
    traversing up the symlinks.
    Tests which test if files are opened should check on gfid path after this change.
    So changed couple of tests to reflect the same.
    
    Note:
    This patch doesn't fix the issue for directories. I think a complete fix is to
    come up with an entry operation serialization xlator. Until then lets live with
    this.

    cluster/dht: Rename should not fail post hardlink creation
    
    In the rename path, we wind the creation of newname hardlink and
    linkto file in dst hashed a the same time. If the linkto creation
    fails, but the link creation succeeds, we enter the failure code
    and cleanup the created newname hardlink.
    
    In the interim if another client looks up newname and finds it as
    a hardlink from FUSE, it could send an unlink for oldname instead
    of a rename. This combined with the above cleanup code could end
    up losing all the files copies, and thereby losing data.
    
    This fix separates these steps into 2 parts, creating the linkto
    first and then the link file, so that post link file creation no
    failures would cleanup the newname file. If linkto fails then link
    is not attempted, thereby not polluting the name space with
    newname.

    cluster/dht: Treat linkto file rename failure as non-critial error
    
    It is a critical failure iff we fail to rename the cached file
    if the rename of the linkto failed, it is not a critical failure,
    and we do not want to lose the created hard link for the new
    name as that could have been read by other clients.
    
    NOTE: If another client is attempting the same oldname -> newname
    rename, and finds both file names as existing, and are hard links
    to each other, then FUSE would send in an unlink for oldname. In
    this time duration if we treat the linkto as a critical error and
    unlink the newname we created, we would have effectively lost the
    file to rename operations.
    
    Repercussions of treating this as a non-critical error is that
    we could leave behind a stale linkto file and/or not create the new
    linkto file, the second case would be rectified by a subsequent
    lookup, the first case by a rebalance, like for all stale linkto
    files

    Rebalance: Avoid setting other component's xattrs
    
    Problem 1:
     In "gf_defrag_handle_hardlink" we used to do setxattr on internal
    afr keys. Which lead to afr aborting the op saying "operation not
    supported".
    
    Solution : Sending a new xattr with only required keys.
    
    Problem 2:
     Hardlink migration tries to create linkto files for 2nd to (n-1)th
    hardlink of a file on their respective hashed_subvolumes. It may so
    happen that the linkto file already exists on the hashed subvolume
    may be due to an earlier lookup or hashed subvolume on the older
    graph is same as that on the new graph. Hence any new link call may
    fail with EEXIST.
    
    Solution: Will log the message with DEBUG level for EEXIST . Otherwise will
    log with ERROR level.

Date:   Fri Aug 8 17:17:20 2014 +0530

    geo-rep/glusterd: API to check active geo-rep session for the volume
    
    Requirement:
    Snapshot needs an API to fail the CLI if any geo-rep session is active
    for that volume.
    
    Solution:
    A function "gd_vol_is_geo_rep_active" is provided to check if any
    geo-rep session is active for that volume. An in memory dict called
    'gsync_running_slaves' is maintained in 'volinfo' structure to keep
    track of active geo-rep session for the volume. The key
    'slavenode::slavevol' with value 'running' is added whenever geo-rep
    is started/resumed into the dict and the same is removed if
    stopped/paused. So the 'count' in dict is used to decide whether the
    geo-rep is active or not for that volume.
    
    Also added "this->name" in gf_log in routines which this patch is
    touched.

    features/changelog: barrier all entry creation fops
    
    when a snapshot is taken, there are chances of entry creation fops
    not being recorded either in changelog or through the recursive
    ancestry xtime updation by marker. This causes consumers of changelog
    (primarily geo-replication as of today) to not be aware of these entries

    is an interim workaround to barrier creates till changelog becomes completely

    xtime of parent directory is updated as stime. With the upper limit

    With this files will get missed if `xtime_of_file == xsync_upper_limit`

    cluster/dht: Fix dht_access treating directory like files
    
    When the cluster topology changes due to add-brick, all sub
    volumes of DHT will not contain the directories till a rebalance
    is completed. Till the rebalance is run, if a caller bypasses
    lookup and calls access due to saved/cached inode information
    (like NFS server does) then, dht_access misreads the error
    (ESTALE/ENOENT) from the new subvolumes and incorrectly tries
    to handle the inode as a file. This results in the directories
    in memory state in DHT to be corrupted and not heal even post
    a rebalance.
    
    This commit fixes the problem in dht_access thereby preventing
    DHT from misrepresenting a directory as a file in the case
    presented above.

    cluster/dht: Modified logic of linkto file deletion on non-hashed
    
    Currently whenever dht_lookup_everywhere gets called, if in
    dht_lookup_everywhere_cbk, a linkto file is found on non-hashed
    subvolume, file is unlinked. But there are cases when this file
    is under migration. Under such condition, we should avoid deletion
    of file.
    
    When  some other rebalance process changes the layout of parent
    such that dst_file (w.r.t. migration) falls on non-hashed node,
    then may be lookup could have found it as linkto file but just
    before unlink, file  is under migration or already migrated
    In such cased unlink can be avoided.
    
    Race:
    -------
    If we have two bricks (brick-1 and brick-2) with initial file "a"
    under BaseDir which is hashed as well as cached on (brick-1).
    
    Assume "a"  hashing gives 44.
    
                                  Brick-1              Brick-2
    
    Initial Setup:               BaseDir/a             BaseDir
                                 [1-50]                [51-100]
    
    Now add new-brick Brick-3.
    
    1. Rebalance-1 on node Node-1 (Brick-1 node) will reset
    the BaseDir Layout.
    
    2. After that it will perform
    a)  Create linkto file on  new-hashed (brick-2)
    b)  Perform file migration.
    
    1.Rebalance-1 Fixes the base-layout:
                     Brick-1             Brick-2           Brick-3
                     ---------         ----------         ------------
                     BaseDir/a            BaseDir           BaseDir
                      [1-33]              [34-66]           [67-100]
    
    2. Only a) is     BaseDir/a          BaseDir/a(linkto)   BaseDir
       performed                         Create linktofile
    
    Now rebalance 2 on node-2 jumped in and it will perform
    step 1 and 2-a.
    
    After (rebal-2, step-1), it changes the layout of the BaseDir.
                        BaseDir/a     BaseDir/a(link)    BaseDir
                        [67-100]           [1-33]        [34-66]
    
    For  (rebale-2, step-2), It will perform lookup at Brick-3 as w.r.t new
    layout 44 falls for brick-3. But lookup will fail.
    So  dht_lookup_everywhere gets called.
    
    NOTE: On brick-2 by rebalance-1, a linkto file was created.
    
    Currently that linkto files gets deleted by rebalance-2 lookup as it
    is considered as stale linkto file.  But  with patch if rebalance is
    already in progress or rebalance is over,  linkto file will not be
    unlinked. If rebalance is in progress fd will be  open and if rebalance
    is over then linkto file wont be set.

    feature/geo-rep: Keep marker.tstamp's mtime unchangeable during snapshot.
    
    Problem:
    Geo-replicatoin does a full xsync crawl after snapshot
    restoration of slave and master. It does not do history crawl.
    
    Analysis:
    
    Marker creates 'marker.tstamp' file when geo-rep is started
    for the first time. The virtual extended attribute
    'trusted.glusterfs.volume-mark' is maintained and whenever
    it is queried on gluster mount point, marker fills it on
    the fly and returns the combination of uuid, ctime of
    marker.tstamp and others. So ctime of marker.tstamp, in other
    sense 'volume-mark'  marks the geo-rep start time when the
    session is freshly created.
    
    From the above, after the first filesystem crawl(xsync) is
    done during first geo-rep start, stime should always be less
    than 'volume-mark'. So whenever stime is less than volume-mark,
    it does full filesystem crawl (xsync).
    
    Root Cause:
    
    When snapshot is restored, marker.tstamp file is freshly
    created losing the timestamps, it was originally created with.
    
    Solution:
    
    1. Change is made to depend on mtime instead of ctime.
    2. mtime and atime of marker.tstamp is restored back when
       snapshot is created and restored.

    changelog_register. Now it is history crawl first.
    Hence working directory would not have been created.
    Create it in gf_changelog_register itself if it is
    not already created.

    glusterd/snapshot:  Inherit the mount options of a original brick
    when creating snapshots
    
    When creating a snapshot a LVM is created at the backend and is mounted
    under /var/run/gluster/snaps/... However, this mount does not inherit
    the mount options for the original brick acting as the parent for the
    snap.
    
    If the snap is restored, this could lead to performance degredations,
    functional limitations, or in extreme scenarios even potential data

    features/changelog: Capture "correct" internal FOPs
    
    This patch fixes changelog capturing internal FOPs in a cascaded
    setup, where the intermediate master would record internal FOPs
    (generated by DHT on link()/rename()). This is due to I/O happening
    on the intermediate slave on geo-replication's auxillary mount with
    client-pid -1. Currently, the internal FOP capturing logic depends
    on client pid being non-negative and the presence of a special key
    in dictionary. Due to this, internal FOPs on an inter-mediate master
    would be recorded in the changelog. Checking client-pid being
    non-negative was introduced to capture AFR self-heal traffic in
    changelog, thereby breaking cascading setups. By coincidence,
    AFR self-heal daemon uses -1 as frame->root->pid thereby making
    is hard to differentiate b/w geo-rep's auxillary mount and self-heal
    daemon.

    geo-rep: minimize xsync crawl usage and set upper limit to xsync crawl
    
    For effective handling of deletes and renames use history crawl
    as much as possible. History crawl will run in loop till it syncs
    all data before live changelog time.
    
    When it uses xsync crawl(fallback when changelog not available, or
    very first crawl) it sets upper limit to crawl.
    
    After completing History crawl, it checks actual end time returned
    by history api to compare with register time, if actual end is less
    than register time then run history crawl one more time.
    
    If first turn history processing time is less than the CHANGELOG
    ROLLOVER TIME then sleep for the difference, After sleep if it is
    guaranteed that rollover will happen and switches to live changelog
    consumption without switching to xsync. This sleep is only when
    history processing completed < CHANGELOG_ROLLOVER_TIME and sleep
    only after the first turn, So will not affect the performance.

    gluster: Fix the recursive goto outs in the source code.
    
    Added a script check_goto.pl, that when run from
    the source code root, will scan all .c files to match
    the following pattern:
    
    label:
            if (condition)
                goto label;
    
    On finding such a pattern the script will print the file name
    and the line number. There are certain cases where the above
    recursive pattern is intended. Hence adding those labels to
    ignore-labels. Thanks Vijaikumar Mallikarjuna for the perl
    script.
    
    Also fixed all such existing errors

    Cluster/dht: fix rename race
    
    Ported from http://review.gluster.org/#/c/8269/
    
    If two clients try to rename the same file at the same time, we
    sometimes end up with *no file at all* in either the old or new
    location.  That's kind of bad.  The culprit seems to be some overly
    aggressive cleanup code.  AFAICT, based on today's study of the code,
    the intent of the changed section is to remove any linkfile we might
    have created before the actual rename.  However, what we're removing
    might not be our extra link.  If we're racing with another client that's
    also doing a rename, it might be the only remaining link to the user's
    data.  The solution, which is good enough to pass this test but almost
    certainly still not complete, is to be more selective about when we do
    this unlink.  Now, we only do it if we know that, at some point, we did
    in fact create the link without error (notably ENOENT on the source or
    EEXIST on the destination) ourselves.

                                                   about to get called.
    
    STATE 4:                         As part of lookup
                                     link file at brick-2
                                     will be created.
    
    STATE 5:                         getxattr to check that
                                     cached file belongs to
                                     this node is done
    
    STATE 6:
    
                                                dht_lookup_everywhere_cbk detects
                                                the link created by rebalance-1.
                                                It will unlink it.
    
    STATE 7:                        getxattr at the link
                                    file with "pathinfo" key
                                    will be called will fail
                                    as the link file is deleted
                                    by rebalance on node-2
    
    Fix:
    So in the STATE 6, we should avoid the deletion of link file. Every time
    dht_lookup_everywhere gets called, lookup will be performed on all the nodes.
    So to avoid STATE 6, if linkto file is found, it is not deleted until valid
    case is found in dht_lookup_everywhere_done.
    
    Case 1: if linkto file points to cached node, and cached file exists,
            uwind with success.
    
    Case 2: if linkto does not point to current cached node, and cached file
            exists:
            a) Unlink stale link file
            b) Create new link file
    
    Case 3: Only linkto file exists:
            Delete linkto file
    
    Case 4: Only cached file
            Create link file (Handled event without patch)
    
    Case 5: Neither cached nor hashed file is present
            Return with ENOENT (handled even without patch)

    features/gfid-access: error handling for entry creation
    
    Proceed with setattr() only on a successfull entry creation.
    Winding a setattr() using a freshlyOC initiated inode would
    most likely fail in one translator or the other (e.g. DHT
    expecting the layout information to be set in the inode
    context), which is the case if the inode was not looked up.
    
    Therefore, gfid-access handles failure entry creations and
    passes the _correct_ errno back to the client instead of
    continuing with setattr() call and probably returning back
    incorrect errno. Also, filling up inode->gfid is required
    as the new inode is not looked up and ->gfid would be
    certainely required for inode operations.

    [1] modified the server resolver code to send ENOENT instead of

    to fail under certain conditions (see bug description).
    
    Fix:
    Since [1] is needed by AFR only in its lookup path, reverted the changes
    introduced by [1]  in resolve_entry_simple () an resolve_inode_simple () and
    made the change instead in server_lookup_resume().

    libglusterfs: Don't allow '-0' as input value for numbers
    
            Backport of http://review.gluster.org/8129
    
    Problem:
    io-stats tries to init log-buf-size as uint32. All gf_string2u*** functions
    which get the unsigned values from string don't want the string to contain '-'.
    So the GF_OPTION_INIT with '-0' as value fails init in io-stats, but by that
    time 'ret' is already reset to 0. Io-stats ends up returning 0 even when init
    failed. Because of this caller of init thinks initialization is successful when
    it is not. iostat_xlator->private is still NULL.  Because of this when a fop
    tries to access members of io-stat-private structure, it crashes.
    
    Fix:
    I initially thought may be we should fix all gf_string2u*** functions to
    accept '-0'. But all these functions are used only for setting volume options.
    If we accept '-0', gluster volume info shows output as follows:
    
    diagnostics.brick-log-buf-size: -0
    
    This seemed ugly, so I felt it is better to disallow '-0' as valid input for
    numbers.
    
    Also fixed return value in cases of failures in io-stats.

    features/changelog: prevent deadlock on thread cancellation
    
    helper threads (fsync, rollover) wake up periodically and perform
    their respective operation under a lock (crt->lock). These threads
    are also subjected to cancellation under some circumstance such as
    disabling changelog. This is inherently dangerous when funtions
    which are cancellation points for pthread_cancel(3) are used
    in the locked region.
    
    Consider this
    
             pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
             {
                    /* ... */
                    ret = fsync (fd);   <-- cancellation point
                    /* ... */
             }
             pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
    
    A pthread_cancel(3) by another thread just before fsync(3) but
    after pthread_mutex_lock(3) would result in the thread getting
    cancelled when fsync(3) is invoked, thereby never unlocking the
    mutex. Moreover, in case of changelog translator, the locked
    region (under crt->lock in changelog-rt.c) is also the code
    path for fop changelog updation. Therefore, unlocking the
    mutex in thread cleanup handler (pthread_cleanup_pop(3)) might
    prematurely release the mutex during fop updation path.
    
    This patch fixes such problems existing in fsync and rollover
    threads. Fix is to enter the locked region with cancellation
    disabled and enable it after mutex unlock. Also, test for a
    cancellation request early on in case none of the functions
    are cancellation points.

    nfs: prevent assertion error with MOUNT over UDP
    
    The MOUNT service over UDP runs in a separate thread. This thread does
    not have the correct *THIS xlator set. *THIS points to the global (base)
    xlator structure, but GF_CALLOC() requires it to be the NFS-xlator so
    that assertions can get validated correctly.
    
    This is solved by passing the NFS-xlator to the pthread function, and
    setting the *THIS pointer explicitly in the new thread.
    
    It seems that on occasion (needs further investigation) MOUNT over UDP
    does not unregister itself. There can also be issues when the kernel NLM
    implementation has been registered at portmap/rpcbind, so adding some
    unregister procedures in the cleanup of the test-cases.

    rpc: Do not reset @ping_started to 0 in ping callback
    
            Backport of: http://review.gluster.org/8257
    
    This is to avoid indefinite recursion of the following kind, that could
    lead to a stack overflow:
    
    rpc_clnt_start_ping() -> rpc_clnt_ping() -> rpc_clnt_submit() ->
    rpc_clnt_start_ping() -> rpc_clnt_ping() -> rpc_clnt_submit() ...
    and so on,
    
    since it is possible that before rpc_clnt_start_ping() is called a
    second time by the thread executing this codepath, the response to
    previous ping request could ALWAYS come by and cause epoll thread to
    reset conn->ping_started to 0.
    
    This patch also fixes the issue of excessive ping traffic, which was
    due to the client sending one ping rpc for every fop in the worst case.
    
    Also removed dead code in glusterd.

    features/gfid-access: Fix entry operations
    
            Backport of http://review.gluster.org/8204
    
    Problem:
    When more than one aux-mounts are performing rmdir .gfid/<pargfid>/dir
    simultaneously, then sometimes a hang is observed.  In gfid-access xlator When
    virtual parent/inode are replaced with real parent/inode in loc, virtual
    pargfid/gfid are not replaced with real pargfid/gfid respectively. Afr is using
    parent_loc->gfids to order the entry locks. But parent_loc->gfid contains
    random/virtual gfid generated by gfid-access xlator. Entrylk in client xlator
    is using loc->inod->gfid for sending entrylk which has 'real' gfid. Because the
    ordering is happening based on random gfids, One mount orders the locks as (L1,
    L2) where as the other orders them as (L2, L1) leading to a dead-lock thus
    a hang.
    
    Fix:
    Replace virtual pargfid/gfid with real pargfid/gfid when virtual-inodes are
    replaced with real-inodes in loc.

    glusterd/snapshot: Change file-system uuid to file-system label
    
    Problem: In XFS changing file-system UUID with xfs_admin is causing
    too much delay with large file-system. The time taken by xfs_admin
    tool to change UUID is directly proportional to the size of the file
    system.
    
    Cause: In XFS file-system UUID is stored in file-system superblock.
    Therefore for chaning UUID all the superblock needs to be changed.
    
    Fix: Instead of using file-system UUID use file-system label.

    feature/changelog: Fix for missing changelogs at backend.
    
    Problem:
           A few changelog files are missing at the backend
           during snapshot with changelog enabled.
    
    Cause:
           Race between actual rollover and explicit rollover.
    
           Changelog rollover can happen either due to actual
           or the explict rollover due to snapshot. Actual
           rollover is controlled by tuneable called rollover-time.
           The minimum granularity for rollover-time is 1 second
           Explicit rollover is asynchronous in nature and happens
           during snapshot.
    
           Basically, rollover renames the current CHANGELOG file
           to CHANGELOG.TIMESTAMP after rollover-time. Let's assume,
           at time 't1', actual and explicit rollover raced against
           each other and actual rollover won the race renaming the
           CHANGELOG file to CHANGELOG.t1 and opens a new
           CHANGELOG file. An immediate explicit rollover at time
           't1' happened with in the same second to rename
           CHANGELOG file to CHANGELOG.t1 resulting in purging the
           earlier CHANGELOG.t1 file created by actual rollover.
    
    Solution:
           Adding a delay of 1 sec guarantees unique CHANGELOG.TIMESTAMP
           during explicit rollover.
    
    Thanks Venky, for the all the help in root causing the issue.

    cluster/dht: handle ESTALE appropriately in rmdir codepath.
    
    Till we separated the scenario of a file/directory not existing from
     parent not existing [1], we used to include a subvolume in the layout
    of a directory even if it is not present on that subvolume. This was
    done to allow a lookup racing with mkdir to create correct layout.
    However, there are other scenarios as well where a directory is not
    present. One such situation is trying to create a directory after an
    add-brick. Since there is no guarantee that all the ancestors are
    created after an add-brick (and hence directory cannot be created), the
    newly added brick should not be part of the layout. However, we used to
    consider newly added brick as part of layout (even before we do
    fix-layout of all the ancestors) and this was the root cause of [2].
    With [1], this issue got fixed and hence [2] got fixed too. However,
    [1] is not complete in the sense we didn't modify rmdir codepath
    appropriately. This patch fixes that gap.

    feature/geo-rep: Fix for changelog agent becoming zombie.
    
    Monitor process spawns changelog agent and is not
    wait on it, hence becoming zombie. When worker is
    dies/killed, it respawns both worker and corresponding

    cluster/dht: Do layout self healing of directory for nameless lookup
    
    Problem: Currently in the  nameless lookup code path, if at the
             end of the lookup, even if it detects that layout
             anamolies are there, layout healing will not be done as
             there is no code to heal it.
             So there can be race between mkdir and lookup.
    
             Assume mkdir is going on from some other mount point,
             Say, M1. Directories are created on some nodes but layout
             is not set yet.
    
             Now from M2, nameless lookup goes, lookup will be success
             full as the directory is present on some of the nodes, but
             it won't heal layout. Now if create goes after lookup fop,
             because layout is absent, file creation will fail.
    
    Fix:     Included the code of layout self-heal in the nameless
             lookup path. At the end of lookup, layout will be computed
             as it would have been in the named lookup, but it will be
             set to those node only, where directory is present.
             So after that if create fop goes, the probabiliy to get the
             subvolume with proper hash-range is high now, so reduces
             the race window.
    
    Other:  Whenever a directory is created, we have to choose a brick
            from which we start allocating layout in a circular fashion.
            To calculate this starting brick, I have changed the candidate
            from name of the directory to gfid of the directory
    
            But to compute where a given file belongs, we will still
            use the name of the file. Hash computed from the name of the
            file should belong to any one of the directory-hash-range
    
            Calculation of hash for a file is acting as a consumer and the
            setting of directory layout based on gfid is acting as a producer,
            which are independent from each other.

    glusterd: Use blocking quotad start only on quota enable
    
      Backport of http://review.gluster.org/8082 from upstream
    
    Having quotad always being using the blocking runner variant is
    problematic. In some cases where quotad was started from the epoll
    thread, it lead to a deadlock which lead to glusterd becoming
    unresponsive.
    
    This patch makes the default quotad_start function use the non-blocking
    runner_nowait variant. The blocking start is used only when quotad is
    started on quota enable command.

    DHT/readdirp: Directory not shown/healed on mount point if exists
                  on single brick(non first up subvolume).
    
    Problem: If snapshot is taken, when mkdir has succeeded only on
    hashed_subvolume, then after restoring snapshot the directory
    is not shown on mount point.
    
    Why:    dht_readdirp takes only those directory entries in to
    account, which are present on first_up_subvolume. Hence, if the
    "hashed subvolume" is not same as first_up_subvolume, it wont be listed
    on mount point and also not healed.
    
    Solution:
    Case 1: If rebalance is running then read the entry from first_up_subvol.
    	why : Let say we ran in to a situation, where the new added brick
    	became the hashed_subvolume for a directory entry. As the directory
    	entry will be not present on its new hashed subvolume, rebalance
    	readdir will not be able to read that entry.
    
    Case 2: (Rebalance not running)If hashed subvolume is NULL or down then
    filter in first_up_subvolume. Other wise the corresponding hashed subvolume
    will take care of the directory entry.
    
    Case 3: If readdirp_optimize option is turned on then read from first_up_subvol

    dht/rebalance: Do not allow rebalance when gfid mismatch found
    
    Due to race condition, it may so happen that, gfid obtained
    in readdirp and gfid found by lookup are different for a given
    name. in that case do no allow the rebalance.
    
    Readdirp of an entry will bring the gfid, which will be stored
    in the inode through inode_link, and when lookup is done and
    gfid brought by lookup is different from the one stored in the
    inode, client3_3_lookup_cbk will return ESATLE and error will be
    captured by rebalance process.

    Fix resolution issues across fuse/server/afr
    
            Backport of http://review.gluster.com/#/c/8015/
    
    Problems with fuse/server:
    Fuse loc touch up sets loc->name even when pargfid
    is not known. Server lookup does (pargfid, name) based
    lookup when name is set ignoring the gfid. Because of this server
    resolver finds that the lookup came on (null-pargfid, name) and
    fails the lookup with EINVAL.
    
    Fix:
    Don't set loc->name in loc_touchup if the pargfid is not known.
    Did the same even for server-resolver
    
    Problem with afr:
    Lets say there is a directory hierarchy a/b/c/d on the mount and the
    user is cd'ed into the directory. Bring down one of the bricks of replica and
    remove all directories/files to simulate disk replacement on that brick. Now
    this brick is brought back up. Creates on the cd'ed directory fail with ESTALE.
    Basically before sending a create of 'f' inside 'd', fuse sends a lookup to
    make sure the file is not present.  On one of the bricks  'd' is present and
    'f' is not so it sends ENOENT as response. On the new brick 'd' itself is not
    present. So it sends ESTALE. In afr ESTALE is considered to be special errno on
    witnessing which lookup has to fail. And ESTALE is given more priority than
    ENOENT. Due to these reasons lookup fails with ESTALE rather than ENOENT. Since
    lookup didn't fail with ENOENT, 'create' can't be issued so the command is
    failed with ESTALE.
    
    Solution:
    Afr needs to consider ESTALE errno normally and ENOENT needs to
    be given more priority so that operations like create can proceed even when
    only one of the brick is up and running. Whenever client xlator identifies
    that gfid-changed, it sets that information in lookup xdata. Afr uses this
    information to fail the lookup with ESTALE so that top xlator can send
    fresh lookup.

    glusterd: More backward compatability fixes
    
    This patch fixes this some more backwards incompatability issues in
    RHS-3.0. The following issues have been fixed,
    
    - A volumes op-versions
    Though RHS-2.1 supports op-versions and makes use of volume op-versions,
    it doesn't save/restore or import/export a volumes op-version. Instead
    it calculates the op-versions based on the options set on the volume
    during import and restore. RHS-3.0 doesn't do this, which can lead to
    volumes being mismatched and peers being rejected.
    
    - A brick's mount dir, required by snapshot.
      This is a backport of change http://review.gluster.org/8046 from
      upstream
    Several volume operations, start, add-brick and replace-brick, expected
    the presence of a bricks mount directory, which is required for the
    snapshot feature. This should only be expected when snapshot is
    supported in the cluster.

    During commit the first thing that should happen is the

    So that if the node goes down the marked snap can be
    cleaned up when the node is coming back. Also during snap
    handshake while accepting snapshot from peer, we should
    check if the snap in question is decomissioned. In that
    case we shouldn't be accepting the peer data.

    glusterd/snapshot : Provide enable/disable option for snapshot auto-delete feature.
    
    This patch provides an interface to enable or disable
    the auto-delete feature.
    Syntax : gluster snapshot config auto-delete <enable/disable>
    
    DETAILS :
    
    1) When auto-delete feature is disabled, If the the soft-limit is
    reached then user is given a warning about exceeding soft-limit
    along with successful snapshot creation message (oldest snapshot is
    not deleted). And upon reaching hard-limit further snapshot creation
    is not allowed.
    
    Example :
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    |Case - 1: Upon reaching soft-limit
    |
    |Snapshot create : snap successfully created.
    |Warning : soft-limit of volume (vol) is reached. Snapshot creation
    |is not possible once hard-limit is reached.
    |
    |-----------------------------------------------------
    |Case - 2: Upon reaching hard-limit
    |
    |Snapshot create : snap creation failed.
    |Error : hard-limit of volume (vol) is reached, Hence it is not
    |possible to take further snapshots. Please delete few snapshots
    |of the volume (vol) before taking another snapshot.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    2) When auto-delete feature is enabled, then as soon as the soft-limit
    is reached the oldest snapshot is deleted for every successful snapshot
    creation (same as existing method), With this it is made sure that
    number of snapshot created is not more than snap-max-hard-limit.

    mgmt/glusterd: delete only the oldest snapshot as part of autodelete
    
    Now this is how autodelete behaves:
    1) Upon creation when the max-soft-limit exceeds, the oldest snapshot is
       deleted. i.e if hard limit is 100 and by default soft limit is 90.
       Whenever snap count reaches 90, every new create results in the deletion
       of the oldest snapshot.
    2) If the snap limit (hard) is reconfigured and brought down
       the current snap count, then no snapshot is deleted and the next snapshot
       create fails as the current snapcount is more than the hard limit.
    3) When soft limit is brought down: say max limit is 100 and by default soft
       limit is 90 and current snap count is 90. Now, soft limit is changed to
       70 (70%). In this case the snapshot count remains 90 itself (i.e extra
       20 snapshots more than the soft limit are not deleted) and for every new
       create the oldest snapshot is deleted.

    Now, gfid is printed as opposed to path in cleanup messages.
    
    Also, refkeeper update is eliminated in inodelk and entrylk.
    Instead, the patch ensures inode and pl_inode are kept alive as
    long as there is atleast one lock (granted/blocked) on an inode.
    
    Also, every inode is unref'd appropriately on a DISCONNECT from the
    lock-owning client.

    glusterd: Fixes to op-versions for RHS-3.0
    
    As RHS-3.0 has been branched from the upstream master branch and isn't a
    direct continuation of RHS-2.1, there are several differences with
    op-versions in it. This patch fixes these issues. The fixes include,
    
    - GD_OP_VERSION_MAX has been set to 30000. Starting with RHS-3.0, the
      op-versions for every release will be set based on the X.Y.Z RHS
      version number. (X = Major version, Y = Minor Version, Z = Update
      version). The op-version will be set to XYZ with Y and Z being 2
      digits wide always being padded with 0 when needed. This gives the
      op-version for RHS-3.0 as 30000.
    
    - Refactor the macro GD_OP_VERSION_4 to GD_OP_VERSION_RHS_3_0 and change
      its values to the 30000 from 4.
    
    - Change the op-versions of options with op-version 4 and most of the
      options with op-version 3 in the volume set table to
      GD_OP_VERSION_RHS_3_0.
    
    - Change the op-version of the features which were backported to RHS-2.1
      from upstream to 2.
    
    - Some nfs options which were introduced into the volume set table in
      this release, had op-versions set to older values. These were changed
      to GD_OP_VERSION_3_0.

    synctask-thread waiting for the big_lock.
    
    Solution is not to start_brick from from synctask

    features/gfid-access: calloc gfid and set in xdata
    
    Upstream patch: http://review.gluster.org/7978
    
    Problem: the gfid passed to ga_fill_tmp_loc() was a stack variable which
    the function set in the xdata dictionary. Accessing it in a later point
    in time gave unexpected values.
    
    This was easy to hit when AFR was involved like so:
    ga_mknod()--->xxx-->afr_mknod():
    In afr_mknod transaction, once the stack-winds for the lock-phase are sent,
    the gfid in xdata becomes out of scope. When we send the actual op i.e.
    afr_mknod_wind(), the gfid in xdata is stale, causing posix to set junk
    gfids on the files.
    
    Fix:
    calloc the gfid and set it in the dict.
    
    Thanks to Pranith for the RCA!

    glusterd: Preserve backward compatibility during sync and store
    
    The glusterd volinfo struct gained several new members to support the
    volume snapshot feature. These members are also being exported/imported
    during volume sync and being stored/restored. This export/import and
    save/restore explicitly required these members to be present, and would
    fail if they were not. This lead to the failure of backward
    compatibility, preventing new peers from correctly interacting with
    older peers (especially during a rolling upgrade).
    
    This patch contains changes needed to preserve the backward
    compatibility in the places specified. The snapshot members of the
    volinfo will now be exported/imported and stored only when the cluster
    op-version is >= 4, ie. all peers in the cluster support snapshot.
    No change is required for the restore code as, the new members will be
    left at the default zero values if corresponding entries are absent in
    the stored volinfo.

    glusterd: Handle rpc_connect failure in the event handler
    
    This is a backport of http://review.gluster.org/#/c/7843
    
    Currently rpc_connect calls the notification function on failure in the
    same thread, glusterd notification holds the big_lock and
    hence big_lock is released before rpc_connect
    
    In snapshot creation, releasing the big-lock before completeing
    operation can cause problem like deadlock or memory corruption.
    
    Bricks are started as part of snapshot created operation.
    brick_start releases the big_lock when doing brick_connect and this
    might cause glusterd crash.
    There is a similar issue in bug# 1088355.
    
    Solution is let the event handler handle the failure than doing it in
    the rpc_connect.

    snapview-server: use telldir api to get the offset of the dentry
    
    * dirent structure (struct dirent) in NetBSD does not contain the offset
      member. Direct access of offset from struct dirent (used here to copy
      its contents to gf_dirent_t structure after making readdir call) causes
      glusterfs build failures on NetBSD. So like posix does, use telldir api
      to get the offset of the dentry (in this case glfs_telldir).

    glusterd/status : First fetch the snapcount and then send the rpc call
    for individual snapshots for snapshot status
    
    Problem :
    
    Initially, we used to do all the calculation in the
    glusterd side, once all the information related to
    snap was fetched, it was aggregated into one
    dictionary and that was sent back to CLI. Problem
    with this approach was, when number of snapshots
    are very high then CLI will timeout.
    
    Solution:
    
    First fetch snapcount and snapname from glusterd,
    then make a individual calls using the snapname
    fetched. This will resolve the timeout problem.

    cluster/dht: Fix min-free-disk calculations when quota-deem-statfs is on
    
            Backport of review.gluster.org/#/c/7845
    PROBLEM:
    
    As part of file creation, DHT sends a statfs call to all of its
    sub-volumes and expects in return the local space consumption and
    availability on each one of them. This information is used by DHT to
    ensure that atleast min-free-disk amount of space is left on each
    sub-volume in the event that there ARE other sub-volumes with more
    space available.
    But when quota-deem-statfs is enabled, quota xlator on every brick
    unwinds the statfs call with volume-wide consumption of disk space.
    This leads to miscalculation in min-free-disk algo, thereby misleading
    DHT at some point, into thinking all sub-volumes have equal available
    space, in which case DHT keeps sending new file creates to subvol-0,
    causing it to become 100% full at some point although there ARE other
    subvols with ample space available.
    
    FIX:
    
    The fix is to make quota_statfs() behave as if quota xlator weren't
    enabled, thereby making every brick return only its local consumption
    and disk space availability.

    features/quota: Send the immediate parent with limit in quota statfs adjustment
    
    Problem:
    Assume the directory structure /quota_limit_dir/subdir and quota_limit_dir is
    set with some limit. When quota-deem-statfs is enabled the output of
    'df /quota_limit_dir' would display quota modified values wrt to
    quota_limit_dir where as 'df /quota_limit_subdir/subdir' would display the
    quota modified values wrt volume root (/).
    
    This behaviour is not expected since, when mounted with subdirectory admin
    doesn't want users to know information above the subdirectory mounted.
    
    Solution:
    Any subdirectory within a quota_limit_dir would show the modified values as in
    the /quota_limit_dir. It searches for the nearest parent that has quota limit
    set and modifies the statvfs wrt that.

    gsyncd / geo-rep: Mountbroker cli to use INET sockets
    
    unprivileged geo-replication session runs the slave gsyncd
    process as unprivileged, thereby executing gluster cli commands
    as an unprivileged user. By default, cli to glusterd
    uses unix domain sockets, thereby restricting cli command
    execution by non root users.
    
    This patch introduces '--remote-host' cli option to force
    cli to use INET socket. For this to work, the following
    needs to be added in glusterd volfile
    
          option rpc-auth-allow-insecure on

    gsyncd / geo-rep: fix cli query for volinfo fetch
    
    With an unprivileged geo-replication session, monitor
    was using user@slave for --remote-host option for gluster
    cli, thereby failing to sucessfully connect to the slave
    glusterd.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by selecting the hostname/IP
    from the speicified slave endpoint url.
    
    - For privileged geo-replication sessions, this patch
    has no effect as the slave endpoint url is just the
    hostname/IP.

    - Have common place to perform quorum fop wind check
    - Check if fop succeeded in a way that matches quorum
      to avoid marking changelog in split-brain.

    cluster/afr: Remove eager-lock stub on finodelk failure
    
            Backport of http://review.gluster.org/7748
    
    Problem:
    For write fops afr's transaction eager-lock init adds transactions
    that can share eager-lock to fdctx list. But if eager-lock finodelk
    fop fails the stub remains in the list. This could later lead to
    corruption of the list and lead to infinite loop on the list
    leading to a mount hang.
    
    Fix:
    Remove the stub when finodelk fails.

    glusterd/geo-rep: Allow gverify.sh and S56glusterd-geo-rep-create-post.sh to operate for non-root privileged slave volume
    
    Mounting the slave-volume on local node, to perform disk checks
    in order to allow gverify.sh to operate for non-root privileged
    slave volume
    
    Allowing the hook script S56glusterd-geo-rep-create-post.sh
    to operate for non-root privileged slave volume
    
    Modified peer_add_secret_pub.in to accept username as argument
    and add the pem keys to the users's_home_dir/.ssh/authorized_keys
    
    Wrote set_geo_rep_pem_keys.sh which accepts username as argument
    and copies the pem keys from the user's home directory to
    $GLUSTERD_WORKING_DIR/geo-replication/ and then copies the keys
    to other nodes in the cluster and add them to the respective
    authorized keys. The script takes as argument the user name and
    assumes that the user will be present in all the nodes in the
    cluster. It is not needed for root.
    
    To summarize:
    For a privileged slave user, execute the following on master node as super user:
    gluster system:: execute gsec_create
    gluster volume geo-replication <master_vol> [root@]<slave_ip>::<slave_vol> create push_pem
    
    For a non-privileged slave user execute the following on master node as super user:
    gluster system:: execute gsec_create
    gluster volume geo-replication <master_vol> <slave_user>@<slave_ip>::<slave_vol> create push_pem
    then on the slave node execute the following as super user:
    /usr/local/libexec/glusterfs/set_geo_rep_pem_keys.sh <slave_user>

    gsyncd / geo-rep: Partial support for Non-root geo-replication.
    
    This patch enables geo-replication to be run as an unprivileged
    user. As of now, this is just the partial support, but is very
    close to achieve full functionality.
    
    Current limitation
    * Geo-replication executed Gluster CLI commands on the slave
      via SSH. On a non-root setup, Gluster CLI would run as an
      unprivileged user, failing to execute the command. As a
      workaround (for testing), setuid(2) Gluster CLI executable
      or use the glusterd option to accept commands by unprivileged
      CLI process. The nature of cli commands are "system::"
      commands (for key management) and remote volume info fetching.
    
    Remote volume info fetching has been modified to use --remote-host
    gluster cli option rather than ssh and remote cli execution.

    Facilitates Glusterfs with the ability to detect file-operations
    happened in past by scanning the back-end(brick-level) glusterfs
    journal (changelog).
    
    Design:
      * List of changelogs produces in one perfectly running session are
        stored in htime file which also holds necessary information about
        the session start and end time.
      * Involves fixed sized seeks to identify N'th changelog in the list.
      * Requires O(log n), (where n is number of changelogs in the list),
        time to identify the end changelog for the given start-end time
        interval.
    
    Currently the background processing of changelogs is sub optimal. BZ

    libgfapi:  Added support to fetch volume info from glusterd and store in glfs object.
    
    Defined new APIs in the libgfapi module, given a glfs object,
     * to send handshake RPC call to glusterd process to fetch UUID of the volume
     * store it in the glusterfs_context linked to the glfs object.
     * to parse UUID from its cannonical string format into 16-byte array
       before sending it to the libgfapi users.
    
    Defined a RPC call in glusterd which can be used to query volume related
    info by other processes using 'clnt_handshake_procs'.
    
    Note - Currently this RPC call to glusterd process is used only to fetch UUID.
    But it can be extended to get other volume related structures as well.
    
    In addition to the above, defined a new variable to keep track of such handshake
    RPCs still in progress to make sure all the corresponding RPC callbacks have been
    processed before libgfapi returns the glfs object initialized.
    
    Also bumping up the GFAPI current version number since there is a new API
    "glfs_get_volume_id" defined and exposed by libgfapi as part of these changes.

    glusterd: On gaining quorum spawn_daemons in new thread
    
    During startup, if a glusterd has peers, it waits till quorum is
    obtained to spawn bricks and other services. If peers are not present,
    the daemons are started during glusterd' startup itself.
    
    The spawning of daemons as a quorum action was done without using a
    seperate thread, unlike the spawn on startup. Since, quotad was launched
    using the blocking runner_run api, this leads to the thread being
    blocked. The calling thread is almost always the epoll thread and this
    leads to a deadlock. The runner_run call blocks the epoll thread waiting
    for quotad to start, as a result glusterd cannot serve any requests. But
    the startup of quotad is blocked as it cannot fetch the volfile from
    glusterd.
    
    The fix for this is to launch the spawn daemons task in a seperate
    thread. This will free up the epoll thread and prevents the above
    deadlock from happening.

    rpc: implement server.manage-gids for group resolving on the bricks
    
    The new volume option 'server.manage-gids' can be enabled in
    environments where a user belongs to more than the current absolute
    maximum of 93 groups. This option triggers the following behavior:
    
    1. The AUTH_GLUSTERFS structure sent by GlusterFS clients (fuse, nfs or
       libgfapi) will contain only one (1) auxiliary group, instead of
       a full list. This reduces network usage and prevents problems in
       encoding the AUTH_GLUSTERFS structure which should fit in 400 bytes.
    2. The single group in the RPC Calls received by the server is replaced
       by resolving the groups server-side. Permission checks and similar in
       lower xlators are applied against the full list of groups where the
       user belongs to, and not the single auxiliary group that the client
       sent.

    glusterd/snapshot: Don't release big_lock before completing snapshot creation
    
    Releasing the big-lock can cause problem like deadlock or memory
    corruption.
    
    Same happened with bug 1091926 where glusterd on node-2 entered a commit
    phase and released a big-lock.
    
    The originator node received timeout for the commit phase and
    triggered a post-validate cleanup to the node-2.
    
    Now node-2 continued to work with the object that are alreday cleaned-up
    and resulted in a crash.
    
    Solution is to not to release big-lock in the commit phase of snapshot
    creation.

    cluster/afr: Prevent heal info hang when data-self-heal in progress.
    
    Problem:
    For determining whether data-self-heal is needed afr takes blocking
    locks. So if self-heal is indeed in progress on the file, this leads
    to hangs. heal info hung for almost 50 minutes when a 50G file
    is undergoing heal.
    
    Fix:
    When self-heal is in progress there is a live self-heal-domain lock.
    In this stage if a non-blocking inodelk for self-heal-domain lock
    is performed it will fail with EAGAIN. For heal info we can use this
    logic to determing that the file is possibly undergoing heal and inform
    it to user instead of waiting for the completion of self-heal.

    cluster/afr: Prevent heal info hang when data-self-heal in progress.
    
    Problem:
    For determining whether data-self-heal is needed afr takes blocking
    locks. So if self-heal is indeed in progress on the file, this leads
    to hangs. heal info hung for almost 50 minutes when a 50G file
    is undergoing heal.
    
    Fix:
    When self-heal is in progress there is a live self-heal-domain lock.
    In this stage if a non-blocking inodelk for self-heal-domain lock
    is performed it will fail with EAGAIN. For heal info we can use this
    logic to determing that the file is possibly undergoing heal and inform
    it to user instead of waiting for the completion of self-heal.

    glusterd: Allow bumping up the cluster op-version
    
    This patch allows a user to bump up the cluster op-version by doing
      # gluster volume set all cluster.op-version <OP-VERSION>
    
    The op-version will be bumped only if
    - all the peers in the cluster support it, and
    - the new op-version is greater than the current cluster op-version
    
    This set operation will not do any other change other than changing and
    saving the cluster op-version in the glusterd.info file. It will NOT,
    - change any existing volume
    - add the option to the global options list
    - fix the cluster op-version to the given version, it can be bumped up
      by other volume set commands.

    glusterd/snashot: Perform missed snap creates
    
    When a brick is started, and the glusterfsd process requests
    for volfile, the brick_name is sent in the req dict. In
    glusterd, after fetching the spec the brick_name is looked
    up in the missed_snap_list, and any missing snap creates on
    the same brick are performed. After this, the glusterd
    responds back with the specfile.
    
    Also collate brick data from the node's hosting the bricks
    during restore. In case the data is absent, the local node's
    data is used. This is needed to ensure that, during a restore
    we collect the information created when a missed snap create
    is performed.

    glusterd : Volname, brickpath & volfpath length validation
    
    While creating a volume and adding a brick validation for _POSIX_PATH_MAX is
    done on absolute pathname instead of relative pathname due to which a brickpath
    having less than _POSIX_PATH_MAX may also fail the validation if the directory
    length is greater than (_POSIX_PATH_MAX -strlen(brickpath/volume name).
    
    Also this fix addresses one cli response message correction which says the
    volume file is too long instead of brick path is too long (when brickpath
    length validation doesn't fail and vol file length validation fails.)
    
    It is also important to note that with the current design of volfile naming, it
    can not be guranteed that volname and brickpath can have max of _POSIX_PATH_MAX
    characters.

    barrier : fsync call over NFS should be barriered when barrier is enabled
    
    barrier_fsync was not getting hit when fsync call is issued from the
    application over NFS mount.
    Investigation reveals that NFS doesn't send an explicit fsync call to the
    glusterfs server, however NFS converts it with a stable write with O_DSYNC
    flag, so for a fsync call over NFS mount point, barrier feature always
    needs to check for writev and its correspoding flags. So to meet all the
    coditions of write with O_SYNC and fsync getting blocked when barrier is
    enabled the check has been modified with following:
    
          if (!((flags | fd->flags) & (O_SYNC | O_DSYNC)))
    
    Point to be noted here is we need to check both fd's flag and the explicit
    flag  as for NFS write fd->flags is 0.

    The problem here is this flag is not fd's flag and gfapi write does not copy

    cli/hooks : Add volume set options to enable/disable nfs-ganesha support.
    
    1. gluster volume set nfs-ganesha.enable ON/OFF
    If the option is set to ON, the volume field in the nfs-ganesha configuartion file is
    edited. Gluster-nfs is disabled on that volume and the volume is exported using
    nfs-ganesha.
    
    2.gluster volume set nfs-ganesha.host IP
    This is used to provide the IP of the nfs-ganesha host.
    
    Note : nfs-ganesha.host MUST be set before using nfs-ganesha.enable ON
    
    The switch from gluster-nfs to nfs-ganesha is mostly done by the hook-scripts
    in the post phase of the 'set' option. As a result, gluster volume reset does not
    function as it is expected to. By default, nfs-ganesha will be set to off but the
    process  will not be killed.
    
    Hence, a few changes have to be made post 'reset' option as well. Those changes
    also have been added.

    extras/hookscripts: Remove %P from smb share path value.
    
    We had added %P in the value for path in smb share definitions to
    avoid ctdb errors. However, %P does not work well for windows
    clients and they fail to access the share.
    
    Solution for the original problem:
    The error messages were being generated by a monitoring script that ctdb
    runs. The script reads the path value from testparm and tests if it exists
    in the local machine. This particular check does not hold valid for
    virtual file system backends like gluster. There is no harm in asking
    ctdb to not to check the existence of such backend and can be done by
    setting the following config in ctdb.conf:
    
    CTDB_SAMBA_SKIP_SHARE_CHECK=YES.

    storage/posix: do not dereference gfid symlinks before posix_handle_mkdir_hashes()
    
    Whenever a new directory is created, its corresponding gfid file must
    also be created. This was done first calling MAKE_HANDLE_PATH() to get
    the path of the gfid file, then calling posix_handle_mkdir_hashes() to
    create the parent directories of the gfid, and finally creating the
    soft-link.
    
    In normal circumstances, the gfid we want to create won't exist and
    MAKE_HANDLE_PATH() will return a simple path to the new gfid. However if
    the volume is damaged and a self-heal is running, it is possible that we
    try to create an already existing gfid. In this case, MAKE_HANDLE_PATH()
    will return a path to the directory instead of the path to the gfid.
    
    To solve this problem, every time a path to a gfid is needed, a call to
    MAKE_HANDLE_ABSPATH() is made instead of the call to MAKE_HANDLE_PATH().

    glusterd: Differentiate rebalance status and remove-brick status messages
    
    previously when user triggred 'gluster volume remove-brick VOLNAME
    BRICK start' then command' gluster volume rebalance <volname> status'
    showing output even user has not triggred "rebalance start" and when
    user triggred 'gluster volume rebalance <volname> start' then command
    'gluster volume remove-brick VOLNAME BRICK status' showing output even
    user has not run rebalance start and remove brick start.
    
    regression test failed in previous patch. file test/dht.rc and
    test/bug/bug-973073 edited to avoid regression test failure.
    
    now with this fix it will differentiate rebalance and remove-brick

    glusterd/snapshot: Activation and De-activation of snapshot
    
    Previously, snapshots by default were activated on creation and there was
    no option to activate or deactivate them on demand.
    
    This will allow the user to activate and deactivate on demand.
    The CLI goes as follows
    
    1) Activate the snap using a command "gluster snapshot activate <snapname> [force]"
    2) Deactivate the snap using a command "gluster snapshot deactivate <snapname>"
    
    Note: Even now the snapshot will be activated during creation.

    glusterd: avoid repetitive logging of disconnect messages
    
    NFS/SHD process disconnecting from glusterd, when the respective service
    are down, would lead to repeated logging of disconnect related messages,
    owing to the rpc reconnect logic in glusterfs(d). This patch addresses
    that by logging the disconnect only on the first disconnect event.

    glusterd/snapshot : Copy geo-rep status and config files before taking a snapshot.
    
    geo-rep status and conf files needs to be copied before taking a snapshot.
    The idea here is, when the snapshot is restored, these config and status
    files needs to be placed back in geo-replication folder so that
    geo-replication can start with the same state it was when taking
    a snapshot.
    
    Details :
    Before a snapshot is taken, Copy the status and config files present
    in /var/lib/glusterd/geo-replication/.
    
    The files copied are gsyncd.conf and status files of each session
    belonging to a volume whose snapshot is about to be taken.

    glusterd/geo-rep: Looks for state_file and pid-file in gsyncd_template.conf
    
    If entries like state_file or pid-file are missing in the gsyncd.conf
    or if the gsyncd.conf is also missing, glusterd looks for the missing
    configs in the gsyncd_template.conf
    
    status will display "Config Corrupted" as long as the entry is missing in
    the config file.  Missing state-file entry in both config and template
    will not allow starting a geo-rep session.
    
    However stop force will successfully stop an already running session,
    if the state-file entries are missing in both the config file and
    the template, as long as either of them have a pid-file entry.
    
    if the pid-file entry is missing in the gsyncd.conf file, starting a
    geo-rep session will not be allowed.
    
    if the pid-file entry is missing in an already started session, then
    stop force will fetch it from the config template and stop the session.
    
    if the pid-file entry is missing in both the config and the template,
    stop force will fail with appropriate error stating pid-file entry is missing.

    [glusterd/snapshot] Glusterd crashes when a same command
    eg snapshot create is fired simultaneously on a node
    
    Cause: In glusterd_mgmt_v3_initiate_snap_phases() , the function
    glusterd_mgmt_v3_post_validate() asserts on the NULL value of
    req_dic. req_dic is not initialized as
    glusterd_mgmt_v3_initiate_lockdown() is not able to acquire the lock
    and comes to the "out" section, before initializing req_dic
    (via glusterd_mgmt_v3_build_payload)
    
    Fix: Call glusterd_mgmt_v3_post_validate() only if the lock is
    acquired.

    geo-rep: Consume Changelog History API
    
    Every time when geo-rep restarts it first does FS crawl using
    XCrawl and then switches to Changelog Mode. This is because changelog
    only had live API, that is we can get changes only after registering.
    
    Now this(http://review.gluster.org/#/c/6930/) patch introduces History
    API for changelogs. If history is available then geo-rep will use it
    instead of FS Crawl.
    
    History API returns TS till what time history is available for
    given start and end time. If TS < endtime then switch to FS Crawl.
    (History => FS Crawl => Live Changelog)
    
    If TS >= endtime, then switch directly to Changelog mode
    (History => Live Changelog)

    snapshot/config : Fix for bug which states gluster snapshot config
    command should only accept the decimal numeric value.
    
    Syntax : gluster snapshot config [volname]
                                     [snap-max-hard-limit <count>]
                                     [snap-max-soft-limit <percentage>]
    
    Problem : Snapshot config used to consider the alphanumeric value
    staring with digit as an integer (Example: "9abc" is converted to "9").
    
    Solution : Refined the code to check if the entered value is numeric.
    
    This patch also fixes some of the minor problems related to snapshot
    config.
    1) Output correction in gluster snapshot config snap-max-soft-limit.
    2) setting the soft limit to greater than 100% displays that "Invalid
    snap-max-soft-limit 0". The error message used to display "zero" in
    the output, Changed this to display relevant value.
    3) Setting greater than allowed snap-max-hard-limit output needs to
    have space in between.

    glusterd: Ping timer implmentation
    
    This patch refactors the existing client ping timer implementation, and makes
    use of the common code for implementing both client ping timer and the
    glusterd ping timer.
    
    A new gluster rpc program for ping is introduced. The ping timer is only
    started for peers that have this new program. The deafult glusterd ping
    timeout is 30 seconds. It is configurable by setting the option
    'ping-timeout' in glusterd.vol .
    
    Also, this patch introduces changes in the glusterd-handshake path. The client
    programs for a peer are now set in the callback of dump_versions, for both
    the older handshake and the newer op-version handshake. This is the only place
    in the handshake process where we know what programs a peer supports.

    glusterd/snapshot : Dont acquire a lock if config is of
    type DISPLAY.
    
    Problem : Currently we are acquiring a lock if we give
    "gluster snapshot config <volname>". As this is just a
    Read-Only command, we need not acquire a lock.
    
    Solution : This patch checks if the command given is of
    type DISPLAY. If so, then glusterd_v3_mgmt framework is
    not called, as reading information from local node is
    enough.
    
    This Patch also fixes "Assertion failed: volname" while
    doing the system config change when snap create was in
    progress.

    inode will not be linked as an inode with that gfid
    is already linked in inode table. Calling inode-forget
    on that inode leads to assert failure.
    
    Fix:
    Always use linked inode for performing self-heal.
    
    Added inode-forgets in other places as well even though
    its not really a memory leak.

    features/libgfchangelog: APIs to process history changelogs.
    
    1. Create directories in following fashion for history API's
       usage when consumer is registered with libgfchangelog
       shared library through gf_changelog_register.
           scratch_dir/.history
           scratch_dir/.history/.current
           scratch_dir/.history/.processed
           scratch_dir/.history/.processing
    
    2. Added new file 'gf-history-changelog.c' and following APIs
       are provided for consumers to process history changelogs.
    
        1. gf_history_changelog_scan:
                Move processed history changelog file from
                .processing to .processed
        2. gf_history_changelog_next_change:
                Return the next history changelog file entry.
                Zero means all history chanelogs are consumed.
        3. gf_history_changelog_done:
                Scan .processing directory and generate a list of
                change entries.
        4. gf_history_changelog_start_fresh:
                For a set of changelogs, start from the begining.
    
    NOTE: Though this patch provides above funcationalities.

    glusterd/snapshot: Compare and update snapshots during peer handshake
    
    During a peer-handshake, after the volumes have synced, and the list of
    missed snapshots have synced, the node will perform the pending deletes
    and restores on this list. At this point, the current snapshot list in
    the node will be updated, and hence in case of conflicts arising during
    snapshot handshake, the peer hosting the bricks will be given precedence
    Likewise, if there will be a conflict, and both peers will be in the same
    state, i.e either both would be hosting bricks or both would not be hosting
    bricks, then a decision can't be taken and a peer-reject will happen.
    
    glusterd_compare_and_update_snap() implements the following algorithm to
    perform the above task:
    Step  1: Start.
    Step  2: Check if the peer is missing a delete on the said snap.
             If yes, goto step 6.
    Step  3: Check if there is a conflict between the peer's data and the
             local snap. If no, goto step 5.
    Step  4: As there is a conflict, check if both the peer and the local nodes
             are hosting bricks. Based on the results perform the following:
             Peer Hosts Bricks    Local Node Hosts Bricks       Action
                   Yes                     Yes                Goto Step 7
                   No                      No                 Goto Step 7
                   Yes                     No                 Goto Step 8
                   No                      Yes                Goto Step 6
    Step  5: Check if the local node is missing the peer's data.
             If yes, goto step 9.
    Step  6: It's a no-op. Goto step 10
    Step  7: Peer Reject. Goto step 10
    Step  8: Delete local node's data.
    Step  9: Accept Peer Data.
    Step 10: Stop

    glusterd/snapshot: Recreate the mount dirs and mount the lvm snapshots on node reboot.
    
    The lvm snapshots of the bricks are mounted at /var/run/gluster/snaps/ or
    /run/gluster/snaps. These paths being on a tempfs, on reboot are removed.
    So when glusterd starts, we need to recreate these paths, activate the
    respective logical volumes (lvm snapshots of the bricks), and mount
    these logical volumes at their respective paths.

    The root cause is drc_compare_reqs use the wrong compare type. This function
    should use type drc_cache_op_t as its input type. Since all rbtree related code
    (except function rpcsvc_drc_lookup) in drc cache pass drc_cache_op_t as compare
    type. Only rpcsvc_drc_lookup use type rpcsvc_request_t. It has been modified

    Persisting missing snapshot info on disk as well as in memory in
    the following format:

    This data will be stored on disk at /var/lib/glusterd/snaps/missed_snaps_list
    
    In memory we maintain the data as a list of glusterd_missed_snap_info
    in conf, the key for this list are the first two fields,
    i.e NODE-UUID:SNAP-UUID.
    
    For every NODE-UUID:SNAP-UUID, there can be multiple operations missed
    on multiple bricks. So we maintain a list of glusterd_snap_op_t
    for every node of glusterd_missed_snap_info
    
    This list is maintained or updated during snapshot create, delete, and restore
    operations which are the only operations that if missed, are recorded in this
    list.
    
    During snapshot create, if a node is down, or a brick is down, we don't
    receive their mount point infos. snap_status of such bricks is marked as
    -1, and their brick details are added to this list.
    
    During snapshot delete, we check from originator node, if any other
    nodes, holding bricks of the said snap are down. Those are also added to the list.
    Also if the node is up, but the snapshot was pending for a snap
    brick, and its snap_status is -1, we add that to the list too.
    When a subsequent delete entry is processed for an already existing
    create entry, we just mark the create entries status as done (2), and don't
    add the delete entry to the list.
    
    During snapshot restore, we check from originator node, if any other
    nodes, holding bricks of the said snap are down. Those are also added to the list.
    Also if the node is up, but the snapshot was pending for a snap
    brick, and its snap_status is -1, we add that to the list too.
    Like delete when a subsequent restore entry is processed for an already existing
    create entry, we just mark the create entries status as done (2), and don't
    add the restore entry to the list.

    features/locks: Remove stale entrylk objects from 'blocked_locks' list
    
    * In the event of a DISCONNECT from a client, as part of cleanup,
      entrylk objects are not removed from the blocked_locks list before
      being unref'd and freed, causing the brick process to crash at
      some point when the (now) stale object is accessed again in the list.
    
    * Also during cleanup, it is pointless to try and grant lock to a
      previously blocked entrylk (say L1) as part of releasing another
      conflicting lock (L2), (which is a side-effect of L1 not being
      deleted from blocked_locks list before grant_blocked_entry_locks()
      in cleanup) if L1 is also associated with the DISCONNECTing client.
      This patch fixes the problem.

    features/locks: Remove stale inodelk objects from 'blocked_locks' list
    
    * In the event of a DISCONNECT from a client, as part of cleanup,
      inodelk objects are not removed from the blocked_locks list before
      being unref'd and freed, causing the brick process to crash at
      some point when the (now) stale object is accessed again in the list.
    
    * Also during cleanup, it is pointless to try and grant lock to a
      previously blocked inodelk (say L1) as part of releasing another
      conflicting lock (L2), (which is a side-effect of L1 not being
      deleted from blocked_locks list before grant_blocked_inode_locks()
      in cleanup) if L1 is also associated with the DISCONNECTing client.
      This patch fixes the problem.
    
    * Also, the codepath in cleanup of entrylks seems to be granting
      blocked inodelks, when it should be attempting to grant blocked
      entrylks, which is fixed in this patch.

    rpcsvc: Ignore INODELK/ENTRYLK/LK for throttling
    
    Problem:
    When iozone is in progress, number of blocking inodelks sometimes becomes greater
    than the threshold number of rpc requests allowed for that client
    (RPCSVC_DEFAULT_OUTSTANDING_RPC_LIMIT). Subsequent requests from that client
    will not be read until all the outstanding requests are processed and replied
    to. But because no more requests are read from that client, unlocks on the
    already granted locks will never come thus the number of outstanding requests
    would never come down. This leads to a ping-timeout on the client.
    
    Fix:
    Do not account INODELK/ENTRYLK/LK for throttling

    glusterfs-server : barrier timeout tuning fix
    
    Problem : Reconfiguration of barrier timeout through gluster volume set shows a
    success but it never changes the default timeout value which is 120 seconds.
    After digging into the code deeper, it was found that timeout is never modified
    in reconfigure() as the first check i.e. whether barrier is already enabled or
    disabled always fails since barrier option is not modified in this request.
    
    Fix : Introduced notify() in barrier translator which will take care of the rpc
    request to enable/disable barrier. reconfigure() will simply set barrier
    enable/disable and timeout options blindly without any validation.
    
    Please note this patch only contains the changes in barrier translator however
    from complete code flow perspective the caller in the glusterfsd mgmt should
    call notify instead of reconfigure to fix this problem.

    fuse: prevent READDIR(P) from writing to much data to /dev/fuse
    
    In an environment with mixed architectures (32-bit servers, 64-bit
    client), it is possible that the on-wire Reply on a READDIR(P) procedure
    contains more direntries than the client can fit in the maximum size
    that the fuse-request indicated.
    
    A direntry is a dynamically sized structure, because the structure
    contains the name of the entry. The client sends a maximum size in the
    READDIR(P) Call to the server, and the server uses this size to limit
    the number of direntries to return. In case the server can pack more
    direntries in the requested maximum size (due to alignment differences
    between the architectures), it can happen that the client unpacks the
    list of direntries into a buffer that exceeds the maximum size that was
    given in the initial fuse-request.
    
    This change introduces a check for the maximum requested size of the
    fuse-response in fuse_readdir_cbk() and fuse_readdirp_cbk(). When the
    conversion from gluster-direntries to the fuse-direntry format takes
    place, the maximum size is checked, and the 'extra' direntries are
    discarded. The next readdir()/getdents() that is done, will fetch the
    just discarded direntries again.
    
    In addition to this bugfix, some extra logging in send_fuse_iov() and
    send_fuse_data() has been added to help diagnosing similar issues.

    fuse: allow xlators to request for direct-io-mode on virtual files
    
    Translators like meta, create virtual files with dynamic content
    generated only at the time of open(). Therefore the file size
    returned in lookup or stat is 0 (just like files in /proc). However
    the VFS does not read beyond the size, and if the size is 0, no
    READ ever reaches gluster for that file -- unless direct-io-mode
    is enabled.
    
    This patch allows translators to return "direct-io-mode" flag for
    such 0-byte virtual files in xdata of open_cbk/create_cbk.

    In setattr, the inode times may have been explicitly set "back
    in time". In such cases, if the inode ctx times are not force
    set, then they continue to be higher and continue serving the
    higher/older value in future calls to dht_inode_ctx_time_update()

    When mounting fails, mount.glusterfs incorrectly returns 0 for some
    error cases, it should return 1 instead. Also make sure that error
    messages are redirected to /dev/stderr and not printed to stdout.
    
    Unfortunately it is not possible with the current test-scripts to test
    commands like 'mount -t glusterfs ...'. Any mounting of Gluster volumes
    is done directly with the 'glusterfs' command instead.

    cli,glusterd: Improve detach check validation
    
    This patch improves the validation for the 'peer detach' command.
    
    A check for if volumes exist with some bricks on the peer being detached
    validation is added in peer detach code flow (even force would have this
    validation).
    
    This patch also gurantees that peer detach doesn't fail for a volume with all
    its brick on the peer which is getting detached and there are no other bricks on
    this peer.
    
    The following steps need to be followed for removing a downed and unrecoverable
    peer.
    * If a replacement system is available
      - add it to the cluster
      - use replace-brick to migrate bricks of the downed peer to the new
        peer (since data cannot be recovered anyway use the 'replace-brick
        commit force' command)
      or,
      If no replacement system is available,
      - remove bricks of the downed peer using 'remove-brick'

    build: set version based on git tag or specific
    
    This patch brings version and release number generated at build time
    using git tags or fixed content from VERSION file.
    
    With git tag, version/release number are got from output of
    'git describe --tags --match "v[0-9]*"' command.
    
    This behavior can be overriden by having VERSION file with fixed
    version/release.  The VERSION file should have text describing version
    and release for example something like 'v3.4.0-1'
    
    For testing this patch, its required to remove autom4te.cache
    directory to avoid seeing previously set version.

    rpc: warn and truncate grouplist if RPC/AUTH can not hold everything
    
    The GlusterFS protocol currently uses AUTH_GLUSTERFS_V2 in the RPC/AUTH
    header. This header contains the uid, gid and auxiliary groups of the
    user/process that accesses the Gluster Volume.
    
    The AUTH_GLUSTERFS_V2 structure allows up to 65535 auxiliary groups to
    be passed on. Unfortunately, the RPC/AUTH header is limited to 400 bytes
    by the RPC specification: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5531#section-8.2
    
    In order to not cause complete failures on the client-side when trying
    to encode a AUTH_GLUSTERFS_V2 that would result in more than 400 bytes,
    we can calculate the expected size of the other elements:
    
        1 | pid
        1 | uid
        1 | gid
        1 | groups_len
       XX | groups_val (GF_MAX_AUX_GROUPS=65535)
        1 | lk_owner_len
       YY | lk_owner_val (GF_MAX_LOCK_OWNER_LEN=1024)
      ----+-------------------------------------------
        5 | total xdr-units
    
      one XDR-unit is defined as BYTES_PER_XDR_UNIT = 4 bytes
      MAX_AUTH_BYTES = 400 is the maximum, this is 100 xdr-units.
      XX + YY can be 95 to fill the 100 xdr-units.
    
      Note that the on-wire protocol has tighter requirements than the
      internal structures. It is possible for xlators to use more groups and
      a bigger lk_owner than that can be sent by a GlusterFS-client.
    
    This change prevents overflows when allocating the RPC/AUTH header. Two
    new macros are introduced to calculate the number of groups that fit in
    the RPC/AUTH header, when taking the size of the lk_owner in account. In
    case the list of groups exceeds the maximum possible, only the first
    groups are passed over the RPC/GlusterFS protocol to the bricks.
    A warning is added to the logs, so that most system administrators will
    get informed.
    
    The reducing of the number of groups is not a new inventions. The
    RPC/AUTH header (AUTH_SYS or AUTH_UNIX) that NFS uses has a limit of 16
    groups. Most, if not all, NFS-clients will reduce any bigger number of
    groups to 16. (nfs.server-aux-gids can be used to workaround the limit
    of 16 groups, but the Gluster NFS-server will be limited to a maximum of
    93 groups, or fewer in case the lk_owner structure contains more items.)

    The documentation for glfs_set_volfile_server() api says that the

    gfapi: glfs_set_volfile_server() now entertains multiple calls
    
    Previous API:
    
    glfs_set_volfile_server (..., const char *host, ...) - single call
    
    New API's:
    
    glfs_set_volfile_server (..., const char *host1, ...)
    glfs_set_volfile_server (..., const char *host2, ...)
    
    Multiple calls to this function with different volfile servers,
    port or transport-type would create a list of volfile servers
    which would be polled during `volfile_fetch_attempts()`
    
    glfs_unset_volfile_server (..., const char *host, ...) to remove
    a server from the list (this is provided for future usage)

commit 31e34cfd72712c76c127509d14d50eb008743fd5
Author: ShyamsundarR <srangana@redhat.com>
Date:   Fri Dec 20 13:19:00 2013 +0530

    log: enhance gluster log format with message ID and standardize errno reporting
    
    	Currently there are quite a slew of logs in Gluster that do not
    	lend themselves to trivial analysis by various tools that help
    	collect	and monitor logs, due to the textual nature of the logs.
    
    	This FEAT is to make this better by giving logs message IDs so
    	that the tools do not have to do complex log parsing to break
    	it down to problem areas and suggest troubleshooting options.
    
    	With this patch, a new set of logging APIs are introduced that
    	take additionally a message ID and an error number, so as to
    	print the message ID and the descriptive string for the error.
    
    	New APIs:
    		- gf_msg, gf_msg_debug/trace, gf_msg_nomem, gf_msg_callingfn
    
    	These APIs follow the functionality of the previous gf_log*
    	counterparts, and hence are 1:1 replacements, with the delta
    	that, gf_msg, gf_msg_callingfn take additional parameters as
    	specified above.
    
    	Defining the log messages:
    	Each invocation of gf_msg/gf_msg_callingfn, should provide an ID
    	and an errnum (if available). Towards this, a common message id
    	file is provided, which contains defines to various messages and
    	their respective strings. As other messages are changed to the
    	new infrastructure APIs, it is intended that this file is edited
    	to add these messages as well.
    
    	Framework enhanced:
    	The logging framework is also enhanced to be able to support
    	different logging backends in the future. Hence new configuration
    	options for logging framework and logging formats are introduced.
    
    	Backward compatibility:
    	Currently the framework supports logging in the traditional
    	format, with the inclusion of an error string based on the errnum
    	passed in. Hence the shift to these new APIs would retain the log
    	file names, locations, and format with the exception of an
    	additional error string where applicable.
    
    	Testing done:
    	Tested the new APIs with different messages in normal code paths
    	Tested with configurations set to gluster logs (syslog pending)
    	Tested nomem variants, inducing the message in normal code paths
    	Tested ident generation for normal code paths (other paths
    		pending)
    	Tested with sample gfapi program for gfapi messages
    	Test code is stripped from the commit
    
    	Pending work (not to be addressed in this patch (future)):
    	- Logging framework should be configurable
    	- Logging format should be configurable
    	- Once all messages move to the new APIs deprecate/delete older
    	  APIs to prevent misuse/abuse using the same
    	- Repeated log messages should be suppressed (as a configurable
    	  option)
    	- Logging framework assumes that only one init is possible, but
    	  there is no protection around the same (in existing code)
    	- gf_log_fini is not invoked anywhere and does very little
    	  cleanup (in existing code)
    	- DOxygen comments to message id headers for each message

    glusterd: suppress spurious error message during startup

    ----------
    E [glusterd-store.c:1981:glusterd_store_retrieve_volume] 0-: Unknown key:
    brick-0
    ----------
    
    The message is emitted from glusterd_store_retrieve_volume() when it reads the
    volinfo file because it doesn't do anything with the key-value pair. Suppress the
    error. The key is needed by glusterd_store_retrieve_bricks() which anyway
    re-reads it.
    
    Also change the log level to WARNING since we do not error out if an unknown key
    is got while parsing the volinfo file.

    glusterd: op-version check for brickops.
    
    cluster op-version must be atleast 4 for add/remove brick to proceed.
    This change is required for the new afr-changelog xattr changes that
    will be done for glusterFS 3.6 (http://review.gluster.org/#/c/7155/).
    
    In add-brick, the check is done only when replica count is increased
    because only that will affect the AFR xattrs.
    
    In remove-brick, the check is unconditional failing which there will be
    inconsistencies in the client xlator names amongst the volfiles of
    different peers.

    Problem : For remove-brick start operation  all client volfiles are reconfigured

    build: do not create versioned <xlator>.so files
    
    There has been a misspelled option in the Makefile.am files. The option
    is called -avoid-version, and not -avoidversion.
    
    It is not trivial to provide a test-case for this. One way would be to
    check generated RPMs with a command like this (output should be empty):
    
      $ rpm -qlp *.rpm | grep -E '/xlator/.+.so.0'

    geo-rep/glusterd: Fix geo-rep status on introduction of volume lock
    
            Getting op context in 'glusterd_op_gsync_set' is no longer
            valid as it is expected that 'rsp_dict' sent from caller is
            filled. It was fine till now as no one was setting the op
            context. The introduction of volume locks sets it,
            consequently breaking geo-rep status command. Hence the
            code that gets dict from op context if present is removed.
    
            Also corrected some indentation issues in 'glusterd_op_gsync_set'

    geo-rep: Fix ValueError - signal only works in main thread
    
    When a worker process not confirmed within 60 seconds of start
    then monitor thread was terminated instead of stopping and restarting
    the worker thread.
    Before terminate monitor thread tries to add a signal handler for
    SIGTERM to cleanup the stuff before terminate. Signal handling will
    not work inside thread, so ValueError was raised.
    
    This patch will not terminate monitor thread, instead only kills and
    restarts the worker.

    cli:  Rectify grammar in the "Usage" of "rebalance" command
    
    Problem: Currently Usage of rebalance command is : " Usage: volume rebalance
    <VOLNAME> [fix-layout] {start|stop|status} [force] "
    
    1) "force" option can be only used with "start" .
    
    2) "fix-layout" option can be only used with "start"
    
    But the current usage says "fix-layout" operation can be stopped and can get the
    status of "fix-layout" operation and also "stop" ,"status" operation can be used
    with "force" option which is not correct.

    write-behind: track filesize when doing extending writes
    
    A program that calls mmap() on a newly created sparse file, may receive
    a SIGBUS signal. If SIGBUS is not handled, a segmentation fault will
    occur and the program will exit.
    
    A bug in the write-behind translator can cause the creation of a sparse
    file created with open(), seek(), write() to be cached. The last write()
    may not be sent to the server, until write-behind deems this necessary.
    
    * open(.., O_TRUNC, ...)/creat() the file, it is 0 bytes big
    * seek() into the file, use offset 31
    * write() 1 byte to the file
    * the range from byte 0-30 are unwritten so called 'sparse'
    
    The following illustration tries to capture this:
    
        Legend:
        [ = start of file
        _ = unallocated/unwritten bytes
        # = allocated bytes in the file
        ] = end of file
    
        [_______________#]
         |              |
         '- byte 0      '- byte 31
    
    Without this change, reading from byte 0-30 will return an error, and
    reading the same area through an mmap()'d pointer will trigger a SIGBUS.
    Reading from this range did not trigger the outstanding write() to be
    flushed. The brick that receives the read() (translated over the network
    from mmap()) does not know that the file has been extended, and returns
    -EINVAL. This error gets transported back from the brick to the
    glusterfs-fuse client, and translated by the Linux kernel/VFS into
    SIGBUS triggered by mmap().
    
    In order to solve this, a new attribute to the wb_inode structure is
    introduced; the current size of the file. All FOPs that can modify the
    size, are expected to update wb_inode->size. This makes it possible for
    extending writes with an offset bigger than EOF to mark the unwritten
    area as modified/pending.

    Because of http://review.gluster.org/#/c/6318/ patch,
    ESTALE is returned for a lookukp on non-existent GFID.
    But ENOENT is more appropriate when lookup happens
    through virtual .gfid directory on aux-gfid-mount

    of gfid-access-translator like geo-rep which expects

    build: fail configure if the libxml2 devel package is missing.
    
    Problem:
    Geo-replication uses volume info xml output.
    While installing glusterfs through build+install from source,
    and if the libxml2-devel package is not present in the system,
    build will succeed with just warning and XML output : no.
    If user fails to observe this and doesn't know that
    geo-rep is dependent on xml output, user won't be able use
    geo-rep.
    
    Solution:
    If libxml2-devel is unavailable, and if geo-rep is enabled error out in configure,
    otherwise just warn with XML_OUTPUT = no.
    If the xml-output is disabled while configuring, error out if
    geo-rep is enabled, otherwise just warn.

    This caused failures while building rpms on epel7 and fedora-{19,20}, as
    the hardened CFLAGS passed by rpmbuild on these distros were discarded

    libgfapi: In glfs_resolve_at(), do not override the previous return value.
    
    Overriding ret to contain glfs_loc_touchup()s' return value implies that
    if glfs_loc_touchup() is successful, glfs_resolve_at() is also successful
    which is not necessarily true. This was causing glfs_resolve_at() to
    succeed even if it couldn't resolve, thus create and other fops would
    fail. Hence overriding ret only if glfs_loc_touchup() fails.

    protocol/client: conn-id should be unique when lk-heal is off
    
    Problem:
    It was observed that in some cases client disconnects
    and re-connects before server xlator could detect that a
    disconnect happened. So it still uses previous fdtable and ltable.
    But it can so happen that in between disconnect and re-connect
    an 'unlock' fop may fail because the fds are marked 'bad' in client
    xlator upon disconnect. Due to this stale locks remain on the brick
    which lead to hangs/self-heals not happening etc.
    
    For the exact bug RCA please look at
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1049932#c0
    
    Fix:
    When lk-heal is not enabled make sure connection-id is different for
    every setvolume. This will make sure that a previous connection's
    resources are not re-used in server xlator.

    glusterd priv
    
    Moved glusterd_op_send_cli_response() out of gd_unlock_op_phase

    Changed log levels from ERROR to WARNING for some volume lock logs
    where the logs are expected and is not an error
    
    Added logs for better transparency of transaction ids.

    geo-rep: Fix gsyncd restart issue.
    
    New function 'glusterd_gsync_op_already_set' is written which compares
    the geo-rep configuration value in gsync.conf with the one sent from
    cli. The generic function is written to compare op_value for any
    op_name sent from cli as this issue can happen with any configuration
    setting other than use-tarssh also. This routine is used to avoid
    restart of gsyncd if the configuration value is set to same as in
    gsyncd.conf.
    
    Also added error checking when glusterd_gsync_configure fails.
    Earlier, eventhough 'glusterd_gsync_configure' fails, error
    was not getting catched and success message was shown.

    gfapi: Set log level to GF_LOG_NONE after closing log file in glfs_fini
    
    Currently any logs that are logged after calling glfs_fini will
    appear on stderr. Ideally to the end of the glfs_fini all the
    operations will be complete and there should be no further logging.
    But it appears that the client translator is still up and prints
    some log messages even after calling glfs_fini.
    
    In this patch the log level is set to GF_LOG_NONE once the log file
    is closed. This fix is not required if wait for "CHILD_DOWN" event
    is implemented in glfs_fini.

    storage/posix: perform chmod after chown.
    
    Problem:
    When a replica brick is added to a volume, set-user-ID and set-group-ID
    permission bits of files are not set correctly in the new brick. The issue
    is in the posix_setattr() call where we do a chmod followed by a chown.
    
    But according to the man pages for chown:
    When the owner or group of an executable file are changed by an unprivileged
    user the S_ISUID and S_ISGID mode bits are cleared.  POSIX does not specify
    whether this also  should  happen  when  root does the chown().
    
    Fix:
    Swap the chmod and chown calls in posix_setattr()

    protocol/server: do not do root-squashing for trusted clients
    
    * As of now clients mounting within the storage pool using that machine's
      ip/hostname are trusted clients (i.e clients local to the glusterd).
    
    * Be careful when the request itself comes in as nfsnobody (ex: posix tests).
      So move the squashing part to protocol/server when it creates a new frame
      for the request, instead of auth part of rpc layer.
    
    * For nfs servers do root-squashing without checking if it is trusted client,
      as all the nfs servers would be running within the storage pool, hence will
      be trusted clients for the bricks.
    
    * Provide one more option for mounting which actually says root-squash
      should/should not happen. This value is given priority only for the trusted
      clients. For non trusted clients, the volume option takes the priority. But
      for trusted clients if root-squash should not happen, then they have to be
      mounted with root-squash=no option. (This is done because by default
      blocking root-squashing for the trusted clients will cause problems for smb
      and UFO clients for which the requests have to be squashed if the option is
      enabled).
    
    * For geo-replication and defrag clients do not do root-squashing.
    
    * Introduce a new option in open-behind for doing read after successful open.

    glusterd: Volume locks and transaction specific opinfos
    
    With this patch we are replacing the existing cluster-wide
    lock taken on glusterds across the cluster, with volume locks
    which are also taken on glusterds across the cluster, but are
    volume specific. So with the volume locks we are able to perform
    more than one gluster operation at the same time, as long as the
    operations are being performed on different volumes.
    
    We maintain a global list of volume-locks (using a dict for a list)
    where the key is the volume name, and which saves the uuid of the
    originator glusterd. These locks are held and released per volume
    transaction.
    
    In order to acheive multiple gluster operations occuring at the
    same time, we also separate opinfos in the op-state-machine, as a
    part of this patch. To do so, we generate a unique transaction-id
    (uuid) per gluster transaction. An opinfo is then associated with
    this transaction id, which is used throughout the transaction. We
    maintain a run-time global list(using a dict) of transaction-ids,
    and their respective opinfos to achieve this.

    cluster/dht: If hashed_subvol is NULL, do not fail
    
    Problem: With the current implementation we are allowing unlink
    of a file if hashed subvol is down and cached subvol is up.
    For the above op to work we should have the info of hashed_subvol.
    But incase we do remount of the volume we will have a zeroed layout
    for the disconnected subvol(start=0, stop=0, err=ENOTCONN) which will
    result  into hashed_subvol being NULL and failing unlink op.
    
    Solution: Dont fail if hashed_subvol is NULL. Check cached subvol
    and unlink in cached subvol. The linkto file in the hashed subvol
    can be remove later.

    Some return values may be explicitly discarded.  This is done to avoid

    gNFS: Possible NULL pointer dereference
    
    In NFS-ACL code (acl3.c) i.e. acl3svc_setacl(), contol can
    go to "acl3err" block from setaclargs.mask validation or
    acl3_validate_gluster_fh() and acl3_map_fh_to_volume() macros.
    But at this point of time "cs" is yet to be init'd (the macro
    acl3_handle_call_state_init() is not yet invoked) which can
    cause a NULL ptr deref.
    
    FIX:
    Refactor the acl3 code.

    Problem : getfattr fails and mount point becomes inaccessible while
    fetching glusterfs.ancestry.path key value for a gfid from aux-gfid-mount
    based mount point.
    
    Analysis : The caller of posix_make_ancestryfromgfid() function i.e.
    posix_get_ancestry_non_directory() is sending an incorrect type value as
    an argument leading to a crash in posix_make_ancestral_node() (head
    dirent pointer is NULL and an attempt to dereference causes seg fault).
    For a non directory operation this piece of code should not have been
    executed but due to incorrect type value this happened.
    
    Solution : In posix_make_ancestryfromgfid() call type is passed as
    logical or of type and POSIX_ANCESTRY_PATH instead of logical or of
    POSIX_ANCESTRY_PATH and POSX_ANCESTRY_DENTRY.

    cluster/dht: Fix layout sorting
    
    The layout was not being sorted in the ascending order leading
    to the wrong detection of holes/overlaps.
    
    From looking at the previous git commits it appears that the initial version itself had the err comparison code.
    Deductions from the current dht_layout_sort():
    1. The zero'ed out layouts should be in the from of list, if needed
    2. The layout should be sorted in the ascending order of layout error value.
    3. The layout should be sorted in the ascending order of the layout 'start'.
    But In some cases, with the err comparison code its not sorted in the ascending order. Example: If the input is as below for dht_layout_sort(), the sorting doesn't happen in ascending order.
    Input:
    0-1 err:0    2-3 err:0   6-7 err:0    0-0 err:20   4-5 err:0
    
    With the current sort, Output:
    4-5 err:0    0-0 err:0    0-1 err:0    2-3 err:0    6-7 err:0
    Expected: 0-0 err:20 0-1 err:0 2-3 err:0 4-5 err:0 6-7 err:0
    Looking at dht_layout_anomalies() it appears that, it doesn't require the layout to be sorted based on error value.
    The other solution was to replace line 468 with:
     if ((layout->list[i].err || layout->list[j].err) && (layout->list[i].start > layout->list[j].start))
    Since dht_layout_anomalies() didn't expect the layout to be sorted based on the error, removed the err comparison.

    cluster/dht: Abandoned memory if a call fails
    
    If the call to dict_set_dynstr() fails, the memory indicated by
    xattr_buf will not have been stored in the dictionary, so it must be
    freed.
    
    Patch set 2: Added a missed call to GF_FREE().  Fixed a formatting

    glusterd: Fix race in pid file update
    
    This patch only removes lines of code. For personal gratification, giving a
    detailed explanation of what the problem was.
    
    When glusterd spawns the local brick process, say when a reboot of the node
    occurs,the glusterd_brick_start() and subsequently the
    glusterd_volume_start_glusterfs() function gets called twice; from
    glusterd_spawn_daemons() and glusterd_do_volume_quorum_action() respectively.
    This causes a race, best described by a pseudo-code of current behaviour.
    
    glusterd_volume_start_glusterfs()
    {
           if(!brick process running) {
    
             step-a) reap pid file( i.e. unlink it)
             step-b) fork a brick process which creates and locks pid file and
                     binds the process to a socket.
    
            }
    
    }
    
    Time            Event
    ----            -----
    T1              Call-1 arrives, completes step-a, starts step-b
    T2              Call-2 arrives, enters step-a as Call-1's forked child is not
                    yet running.
    T3              Call-1's forked child is alive, creates pidfile and locks it,binds
                    its address to a socket.
    T4              Call-2 performs step-a; i.e.unlinks the pid file created by Call-1 !!
                    (files can still be stil be unlinked despite a lockf on it)
    T5              Call-2 does step-b, and the forked child process creates a *new* pid file
                    with it's pid and locks this file.
    T6              But Call-2's brick process is not able to bind to socket as it
                    is already in use (courtesy T3) and hence exits (so no locks anymore on the pidfile).
    
    Result:
    -  Pid file now contains PID of an extinct brick process.
    - `gluster volume status` shows this PID value. It also notices that there is no
    lock held on pid file by the currently running brick process (created by Call-1)
    and hence shows N/A for the online status.
    
    Also, as a result of events at T4, "ls  -l /proc/<brick process PID>/fd/pidfile"
    shows up as deleted.
    
    Fix:
    1.Do not unlink pid file. i.e. avoid step-a. Now at T5,Call-2's brick process
    cannot obtain lock on pid file (Call-1's process still holds it) and exits.
    
    2. Unrelated, but remove lock-unlock sequence in glusterfs_pidfile_setup()
    which does not seem to be doing anything useful.

    build: GFAPI_VERSION should be 6.0.0 not 0.0.6
    
    ------------------------------------->
    "In essence, every time you make a change to the library and
    release it, the C:R:A should change. A new library should
    start with 0:0:0. Each time you change the public interface
    (i.e., your installed header files), you should increment the
    CURRENT number."
    
    So the version which was 3 became 5 when discard API was added
    and became 6 when zerofill was added. As per the above description,
    API addition will result in a change to the installed header (glfs.h)
    and hence warrants a change in CURRENT number ? Should you have
    changed the version to 6.0.0 instead of 0.0.6 ?

    dht: do not remove linkfile if file exist in cached sub volume
    
    Currently with rmdir, if a directory contains only the linkfiles
    we remove all the linkfiles and this is causing the problem when the cached
    sub volume is down and end-up with duplicate files showing on the mount point.
    
    Solution: Before removing a linkfile check if the
    files exists in cached subvolume.

    cluster/afr: Add gfid to index in wind un-conditionally
    
    Problem:
    If brick crashes just after performing xattrop before
    reaching index _cbk then the gfid will not be added to/deleted from
    index. If it is not deleted it will be deleted when self-heal is
    triggered. But if the crash happens before the file is added to index,
    user may think the system does not need self-heal even when there is
    this file that needs to be healed.
    
    Fix:
    Add file to index un-conditionally in wind phase. This way the
    file remains in index even when brick process crashes before reaching
    _cbk. This does not affect performance because of caching(check
    _index_action) built into index xlator.

    * modify local->link_count under locks in ancestry building codepath.
    * before invoking check_limit on newly constructed parents,
      link_count should not be set, but instead incremented by as many
      number of new invocations of check_limit.
    * decrementing link_count and the check whether the count has hit zero
      to resume the waiting call_stub should be atomic.

    cluster/dht: goto statements may cause loop exit before memory is freed.
    
    Memory is allocated at the top of the while loop via a call to
    gf_strdup(), but there are several goto calls that exit the loop, and
    the memory is not freed before each of those calls to goto.  This fix
    moves the final call to GF_FREE() higher in the loop so that the memory
    is correctly freed.
    
    Two variables, dup_str and str_tmp1, point to portions of the allocated
    memory.  Neither are used past the final call to GF_FREE( dup_str ).

    protocol: pass the size of the data in the WRITE on-wire FOP
    
    Capturing GlusterFS traffic with tcpdump and displaying it in Wireshark
    shows that the size of all WRITEs are 0 bytes. It seems that the
    attribute is not used, and the size is calculated an other way.
    
    Even if the size attribute is not used (yet), it should be set correctly
    to prevent confusing while debugging network traffic with Wireshark or
    other tools.
    
    Note that the on-wire format is not being changed with this patch. The
    size is already part of the structure that is exchanged between the
    client and server.

    geo-rep: optimizing update stime after directory synchronization
    
    Since xsync crawl generates new changelog when number of entries
    reaches 8K or when directory is reached. If a directory has number
    of files less than 8K then respective changelog file will have less
    entries. Since xsync generated changelog files processed one after
    the other, so syncjobs are underutilized. hence low bandwidth
    utilization.
    
    With this patch, changelog will be generated for 8K entries only,
    but stime will be accumulated. Multiple dirs stime will be
    updated together since the generated changelog will have entries
    accross the dirs.

    syncop: Change return value of syncop
    
    Problem:
    We found a day-1 bug when syncop_xxx() infra is used inside a synctask with
    compilation optimization (CFLAGS -O2).
    
    Detailed explanation of the Root cause:
    We found the bug in 'gf_defrag_migrate_data' in rebalance operation:
    
    Lets look at interesting parts of the function:
    
    int
    gf_defrag_migrate_data (xlator_t *this, gf_defrag_info_t *defrag, loc_t *loc,
                            dict_t *migrate_data)
    {
    .....
    code section - [ Loop ]
            while ((ret = syncop_readdirp (this, fd, 131072, offset, NULL,
                                           &entries)) != 0) {
    .....
    code section - [ ERRNO-1 ] (errno of readdirp is stored in readdir_operrno by a
    thread)
                    /* Need to keep track of ENOENT errno, that means, there is no
                       need to send more readdirp() */
                    readdir_operrno = errno;
    .....
    code section - [ SYNCOP-1 ] (syncop_getxattr is called by a thread)
                            ret = syncop_getxattr (this, &entry_loc, &dict,
                                                   GF_XATTR_LINKINFO_KEY);
    code section - [ ERRNO-2]   (checking for failures of syncop_getxattr(). This
    may not always be executed in same thread which executed [SYNCOP-1])
                            if (ret < 0) {
                                    if (errno != ENODATA) {
                                            loglevel = GF_LOG_ERROR;
                                            defrag->total_failures += 1;
    .....
    }
    
    the function above could be executed by thread(t1) till [SYNCOP-1] and code
    from [ERRNO-2] can be executed by a different thread(t2) because of the way
    syncop-infra schedules the tasks.
    
    when the code is compiled with -O2 optimization this is the assembly code that
    is generated:
     [ERRNO-1]
    1165                        readdir_operrno = errno; <<---- errno gets expanded
    as *(__errno_location())
       0x00007fd149d48b60 <+496>:        callq  0x7fd149d410c0 <address@hidden>
       0x00007fd149d48b72 <+514>:        mov    %rax,0x50(%rsp) <<------ Address
    returned by __errno_location() is stored in a special location in stack for
    later use.
       0x00007fd149d48b77 <+519>:        mov    (%rax),%eax
       0x00007fd149d48b79 <+521>:        mov    %eax,0x78(%rsp)
    ....
     [ERRNO-2]
    1281                                        if (errno != ENODATA) {
       0x00007fd149d492ae <+2366>:        mov    0x50(%rsp),%rax <<-----  Because
    it already stored the address returned by __errno_location(), it just
    dereferences the address to get the errno value. BUT THIS CODE NEED NOT BE
    EXECUTED BY SAME THREAD!!!
       0x00007fd149d492b3 <+2371>:        mov    $0x9,%ebp
       0x00007fd149d492b8 <+2376>:        mov    (%rax),%edi
       0x00007fd149d492ba <+2378>:        cmp    $0x3d,%edi
    
    The problem is that __errno_location() value of t1 and t2 are different. So
    [ERRNO-2] ends up reading errno of t1 instead of errno of t2 even though t2 is
    executing [ERRNO-2] code section.
    
    When code is compiled without any optimization for [ERRNO-2]:
    1281                                        if (errno != ENODATA) {
       0x00007fd58e7a326f <+2237>:        callq  0x7fd58e797300
    <address@hidden><<--- As it is calling __errno_location() again it gets the
    location from t2 so it works as intended.
       0x00007fd58e7a3274 <+2242>:        mov    (%rax),%eax
       0x00007fd58e7a3276 <+2244>:        cmp    $0x3d,%eax
       0x00007fd58e7a3279 <+2247>:        je     0x7fd58e7a32a1
    <gf_defrag_migrate_data+2287>
    
    Fix:
    Make syncop_xxx() return (-errno) value as the return value in
    case of errors and all the functions which make syncop_xxx() will need to use
    (-ret) to figure out the reason for failure in case of syncop_xxx() failures.

    build: Start using library versioning for various libraries
    
    According to libtool three individual numbers stand for
    CURRENT:REVISION:AGE, or C:R:A for short. The libtool
    script typically tacks these three numbers onto the end
    of the name of the .so file it creates. The formula for
    calculating the file numbers on Linux and Solaris is
    
       /path/to/library/<library_name>.(C - A).(A).(R)
    
    As you release new versions of your library, you will
    update the library's C:R:A. Although the rules for changing
    these version numbers can quickly become confusing, a few
    simple tips should help keep you on track. The libtool
    documentation goes into greater depth.
    
    In essence, every time you make a change to the library and
    release it, the C:R:A should change. A new library should start
    with 0:0:0. Each time you change the public interface
    (i.e., your installed header files), you should increment the
    CURRENT number. This is called your interface number. The main
    use of this interface number is to tag successive revisions
    of your API.
    
    The AGE number is how many consecutive versions of the API the
    current implementation supports. Thus if the CURRENT library
    API is the sixth published version of the interface and it is
    also binary compatible with the fourth and fifth versions
    (i.e., the last two), the C:R:A might be 6:0:2. When you break
    binary compatibility, you need to set AGE to 0 and of course
    increment CURRENT.
    
    The REVISION marks a change in the source code of the library
    that doesn't affect the interface-for example, a minor bug fix.
    Anytime you increment CURRENT, you should set REVISION back to 0.

    features/quota: Metadata cleanup
    
    Quota and marker uses 'trusted.glusterfs.quota*' and 'trusted.pgfid*' xattrs to
    store its configurations and accounting information and also to build the
    parent inode chain in case of absense of path.
    
    Problem:
    After disabling and then enabling quota back, the xattrs may contain stale data
    leading to impaired accounting and thus improper enforcement.
    
    Solution:
    Clean up all the quota related xattrs after quota disable.
    
    Marker xlator implements a virtual xattr to cleanup quota and pgfid xattrs. In
    this approach glusterd mounts an auxiliary mount and sends the below command to
    all the files by crawling the mountpoint.
    
     #setfattr -n "glusterfs.quota-xattr-cleanup" -v 1 <path/to/file>

    dht: Ignore directory with missing xattrs, which have err == 0, and start == stop
    
    From the history (Patch: http://review.gluster.org/4668/)
    
    When subvols-per-directory is < available subvols, then there are layouts
    which are not populated. This leads to incorrect identification of holes or
    overlaps. We need to ignore layouts, which have err == 0, and start == stop.
    In the current scenario (start == stop == 0).
    
    Additionally, in layout-merge, treat missing xattrs as err = 0. In case of
    missing layouts, anomalies will reset them.
    
    For any other valid subvoles, err != 0 in case of layouts being zeroed out.
    Also reverted back dht_selfheal_dir_xattr, which does layout calculation only
    on subvols which have errors.

    With 64, NFS server hangs with large I/O load (~ 64 threads writing

    suggest to set it as 16 instead of 64.

    source and sink. When readlink is done at the sink,
    because link is not present at the sink, afr expects
    ENOENT. AFR translator takes decisions for new link
    creation based on ENOENT but server translator is modified
    to return ESTALE because of which afr xlator is not able
    to heal.
    
    Fix:
    The check for inode absence at server includes ESTALE as
    well.

    glusterd: Relocate rebalance sockfile
    
    The defrag sockfile was moved from priv->workdir to
    DEFAULT_VAR_RUN_DIRECTORY. The format for the new path of the defrag
    sockfile is 'DEFAULT_VAR_RUN_DIRECTORY/gluster-rebalance-<vol-id>.sock'.
    
    This was needed because the earlier location didn't have a fixed length
    and could exceed UNIX_PATH_MAX characters. This could lead to the
    rebalance process failing to start as the socket file could not be
    created.
    
    Also, for keeping backward compatiblity, glusterd_rebalance_rpc_create
    will try both the new and old sockfile locations when attempting
    reconnection.

    rpc/auth: Avoid NULL dereference in rpcsvc_auth_request_init()
    
    Code section is bogus!
    ------------------------------------------
    370:       if (!auth->authops->request_init)
    371:              ret = auth->authops->request_init (req, auth->authprivate);
    ------------------------------------------
    
    Seems to have been never been used historically since
    logically above code has never been true to actually execute
    "authops->request_init() --> auth_glusterfs_{v2,}_request_init()"
    
    On top of that under "rpcsvc_request_init()"
    verf.flavour and verf.datalen are initialized from what is
    provided through 'callmsg'.
    ------------------------------------------
            req->verf.flavour = rpc_call_verf_flavour (callmsg);
            req->verf.datalen = rpc_call_verf_len (callmsg);
    
            /* AUTH */
            rpcsvc_auth_request_init (req);
            return req;
    ------------------------------------------
    
    So the code in 'auth_glusterfs_{v2,}_request_init()'
    performing this operation will over-write the original
    flavour and datalen.
    
    ------------------------------------------
          if (!req)
                    return -1;
            memset (req->verf.authdata, 0, GF_MAX_AUTH_BYTES);
            req->verf.datalen = 0;
            req->verf.flavour = AUTH_NULL;
    ------------------------------------------

    gNFS: mnt3_find_export() by pass AUTH check
    
    NFS subdir mount does not respect nfs.rpc-auth-reject option
    in the volume. If the volume is being mounted, then it would
    validate the AUTH by mnt3_check_client_net() but if the client
    is mounting a subdir, the control takes a different code path
    i.e. mnt3_find_export() which does not bother about the AUTH.
    
    FIX:
    Enforce the AUTH check in mnt3_parse_dir_exports() which is
    invoked by mnt3_find_export() for subdir mount.

    Add the MAINTAINERS file
    
    Different projects (Linux kernel, QEMU, ...) have a MAINTAINERS file in
    the root of the git repository. This file mostly lists the maintainers
    or main committers for certain files and directories. On occasion it
    would be very helpful to know who to add as a reviewer for proposed
    patches.

    Glusterd : glusterd process generates core due to NULL store handle
    
    Problem : glusterd crashed as backtrace revealed that store handle was
    set to NULL.
    
    Solution : In glusterd_store_global_info() function out block the
    handle is dereferenced with out any NULL check which caused this
    segmentation fault. A NULL check is introduced to avoid this. While
    testing this fix, another issue was noticed where GF_ASSERT macro again
    does not gurantee the NULL dereference check and hence this macro call
    has been replaced by GF_VALIDATE_OR_GOTO macro call in places where
    there is a danger of macro getting crashed due to NULL dereference
    check.

    gNFS: Small memory leak in rpcsvc_drc_init()
    
    1. The routine rpcsvc_drc_init() is only used while initialization of
    NFS xlator. It should just check for nfs.drc option and init DRC feature
    accordingly. If it's set to OFF, then rpcsvc_drc_init() allocates memory
    for svc.drc and set ret value to 0 and goes to out: block where drc is
    leaked.
    
    2. rpcsvc_drc_init() should just allocate svc.drc and init it. Here
    svc.drc can never be valid.
    
    3. If svc.drc gets init'd here, no point of checking for drc type here.

    Currently if logfile is closed and other threads call gf_log
    after glfs_fini() is executed, it may lead to memory corruption.
    Adding gf_log_fini() which closes the logfile and initializes
    the logfile to NULL, thus any further logging happens to stderr.
    Also added gf_log_globals_fini() which should be filled in the
    future to release all the logging resources.

    cli: Fix xml output for volume status
    
    The XML output for volume status was malformed when one of the nodes is
    down, leading to outputs like
    -------
              <node>
                 <node>
                   <hostname>NFS Server</hostname>

                   <pid>2130</pid>
                 </node>
    -----
    
    This was happening because we were starting the <node> element before
    determining if node was present, and were not closing it or clearing it
    when not finding the node in the dict.
    
    To fix this, the <node> element is only started once a node has been
    found in the dict.

    cluster/afr: avoid race due to afr_is_transaction_running()
    
    Problem:
    ------------------------------------------
    afr_lookup_perform_self_heal() {
            if(afr_is_transaction_running())
                    goto out
            else
                    afr_launch_self_heal();
    }
    ------------------------------------------
    
    When 2 clients simultaneously access a file in split-brain, one of them
    acquires the inode lock and proceeds with afr_launch_self_heal (which
    eventually fails and sets "sh-failed" in the callback.)
    
    The second client meanwhile bails out of afr_lookup_perform_self_heal()
    because afr_is_transaction_running() returns true due to the lock obtained by
    client-1. Consequetly in client-2, "sh-failed" does not get set in the dict,
    causing quick-read translator to *not* invalidate the inode, thereby serving
    data randomly from one of the bricks.
    
    Fix:
    If a possible split-brain is detected on lookup, forcefully traverse the
    afr_launch_self_heal() code path in afr_lookup_perform_self_heal().

    Problem:
    Whenever a new brick is added into a replicate volume, all
    source bricks are not marked as source. Only one of them is
    marked as source. Here marked as source refers to adding
    extended attribute at the backend of a file corresponding to
    the newly added brick. As well as source bricks should point
    to the newly added brick so that heal can be triggered.
    
    Fix:
    All source bricks will now point to newly added bricks and heal
    can be triggered based on the extended attributes.

    glusterd: Fix stopping of stale rebalance processes
    
    Trying to stop rebalance process via RPC using the GD_SYNCOP macro,
    could lead to glusterd crashing. In case of an implicit volume update,
    which happens when a peer comes back up, the stop function would be
    called in the epoll thread. This would lead to glusterd crashing as the
    epoll thread doesn't have synctasks for the GD_SYNCOP macro to make use
    of.
    
    Instead of using the RPC method, we now terminate the rebalance process
    by kill(). The rebalance process has been designed to be resistant to
    interruption, so this will not lead to any data corruption.
    
    Also, when checking for stale rebalance task, make sure that the old
    task-id is not null.

    gNFS: Client cache invalidation with bad fsid
    
    1. Problem:
    Couple of issues are seen when NFS-ACL is turned ON. i.e.
    i) NFS directory access is too slow, impacting customer workflows
       with ACL
    ii)dbench fails with 100 directories.
    
    2. Root cause: Frequent cache invalidation in the client side when ACL
    is turned ON with NFS because NFS server getacl() code returns the
    wrong fsid to the client.
    
    3. This attr-cache invlaidation triggers the frequent LOOKUP ops for
    each file instead of relying on the readdir or readdirp data. As
    a result performance gets impacted.
    
    4. In case of dbench workload, the problem is more severe. e.g.
    
    Client side rpcdebug output:
    ===========================

    Dec 16 10:16:53 santosh-3 kernel: NFS: dentry_delete(clients/client77, 20008)
    
    As per Jeff Layton, This occurs when the client detects that the fsid on
    a filehandle is different from its parent. At that point, it tries to
    do a new submount of the new filesystem onto the correct point. It means
    client got a superblock reference for the new fs and is now looking to set
    up the root of the mount. It calls nfs_get_root to do that, which basically
    takes the superblock and a filehandle and returns a dentry.  The problem
    here is that the dentry->d_inode you're getting back looks wrong. It's not
    a directory as expected -- it's something else. So the client gives up and
    tosses back an ESTALE.
    
    Which clearly says that, In getacl() code while it does the stat() call
    to get the attrs, it forgets to populate the deviceid or fsid before
    going ahead and does getxattr().
    
    FIX:
    1. Fill the deviceid in iatt.
    2. Do bit more clean up for the confusing part of the code.
    
    NB: Many many thanks to Niels de Vos and Jeff Layton for their
    help to debug the issue.

    rpc,glusterd: Use rpc_clnt notifyfn to cleanup mydata
    
    rpc:
    - On a RPC_TRANSPORT_CLEANUP event, rpc_clnt_notify calls the registered
      notifyfn with a RPC_CLNT_DESTROY event. The notifyfn should properly
      cleanup the saved mydata on this event.
    - Break the reconnect chain when an rpc client is disabled. This will
      prevent new disconnect events which can lead to crashes.
    
    glusterd:
    - Added support for RPC_CLNT_DESTROY in glusterd_brick_rpc_notify
    - Use a common glusterd_rpc_clnt_unref() function throught glusterd in
      place of rpc_clnt_unref(). This function correctly gives up the
      big-lock before performing the unref.

    A dictionary was added to store additional information of a rebalance
    process, like the bricks being removed in case of a rebalance started
    by remove-brick. This dictionary wasn't being stored/restored or synced
    during volume sync, leading to errors like a volume status command
    failing. These issues have been fixed in this patch. The rebalance dict
    is now stored/restored and also exported/imported during volume sync.
    
    Also, this makes sure that the rebalance dict is only create on
    remove-brick start. This adds a bricks decommissioned status to the
    information imported/exported during volume sync.

    glusterd: Fix incorrect remove-brick status
    
    PROBLEM:
    
    'remove-brick status' was reported to be showing the status
    of a previous rebalance op that was aborted, on the node which
    doesn't participate in the remove-brick operation.
    
    FIX:
    
    Unconditionally reset defrag status to NOT_STARTED whenever a
    remove-brick or a rebalance op is attempted.

    mount.glusterfs: getopts support and cleanup
    
    This patch is an attempt to provide some much needed
    cleanup for future maintenance of `mount.glusterfs`
    
    - Add checks for command failures
    - Spliting large code into subsequent simpler functions
    - Standardized variables
    - use 'bash' instead of 'sh' - since string manipulation
      and variable handling is far superior
    - Overall code cleanup and Copyright change to Red, Hat Inc.
    - Add new style of mounting with a comma separated list
      ~~~
      $ mount -t glusterfs <IP1/HOSTNAME1>,<IP2/HOSTNAME2>,..<IPN/HOSTNAMEN>:/<VOLUME> <MNT>
      ~~~
    - Update age old `manpage` with new options :-)

    mount/fuse: cleanup old graphs.
    
    After a graph switch, a PARENT_DOWN event from fuse indicates
    protocol/client to shutdown all its sockets. However, this event will
    be sent only when the first fop is received from fuse mount after
    graph switch. Also, this event is sent only on previously active graph.
    So, if there are multiple graph switches when there is no activity on
    mountpoint, we'll be left with a list of graphs with their sockets
    still open.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by sending PARENT_DOWN to previously
    non-active graph when a new graph is available irrespective of whether
    there is an activity on mount-point.

    libglusterfs: Explicitly open /dev/stderr logfile
    
    Currently if stderr is specified as logfile, /dev/stderr isn't opened but
    stderr is directly used. However libgfapi closes the logfile (and hence
    stderr) from glfs_fini() which results in stderr becoming unavailable for
    the application that links to libgfapi. Prevent this unexpected behaviour
    for the application by explicitly opening /dev/stderr like it is done for
    any other logfile.

    glusterd: Aggregate tasks status in 'volume status [tasks]'
    
    Previously, glusterd used to just send back the local status of a task
    in a 'volume status [tasks]' command. As the rebalance operation is
    distributed and asynchronus, this meant that different peers could give
    different status values for a rebalance or remove-brick task.
    
    With this patch, all the peers will send back the tasks status as a part
    of the 'volume status' commit op, and the origin peer will aggregate
    these to arrive at a final status for the task.
    
    The aggregation is only done for rebalance or remove-brick tasks. The
    replace-brick task will have the same status on all the peers (see
    comment in glusterd_volume_status_aggregate_tasks_status() for more
    information) and need not be aggregated.
    
    The rebalance process has 5 states,
     NOT_STARTED - rebalance process has not been started on this node
     STARTED - rebalance process has been started and is still running
     STOPPED - rebalance process was stopped by a 'rebalance/remove-brick
               stop' command
     COMPLETED - rebalance process completed successfully
     FAILED - rebalance process failed to complete successfully
    The aggregation is done using the following precedence,
     STARTED > FAILED > STOPPED > COMPLETED > NOT_STARTED
    
    The new changes make the 'volume status tasks' command a distributed
    command as we need to get the task status from all peers.
    
    The following tests were performed,
    - Start a remove-brick task and do a status command on a peer which
      doesn't have the brick being removed. The remove-brick status was
      given correctly as 'in progress' and 'completed', instead of 'not
      started'
    - Start a rebalance task, run the status command. The status moved to
      'completed' only after rebalance completed on all nodes.
    
    Also, change the CLI xml output code for rebalance status to use the
    same algorithm for status aggregation.

    If the endpoint of an RPC is not connected, the callback is called
    synchronously within rpc_clnt_submit(). Since callbacks typically

    and acquire it freshly after the call.

    'volume profile info' fetches both cumulative and incremental
    I/O statistics. There isn't a way to fetch just cumulative or

    This change introduces two optional arguments, namely "incremental"
    and "cumulative", that can be tacked on to 'volume profile info'.
    In other words, the new command format is
    
    volume profile <VOLNAME> {start | info [incremental | cumulative]
    | stop} [nfs]
    
    'volume profile info incremental' - fetches incremental stats
    'volume profile info cumulative' - fetches cumulative stats

    features/marker: Filter quota xattrs on file as well
    
    Problem:
    Quota contributions of a file/directory are tracked by quota
    xlator using xattrs on the file. Quota allows these xattrs to be
    healed as part of metadata self-heal. This leads to
    wrong quota calculations on this brick after self-heal because
    quota xattrs don't represent the actual contributions on the
    brick anymore.
    
    Fix:
    Don't let self-heal of this xattr happen as part of self-heal
    by filtering quota xattrs on file in listxattr.

    features/quota: Add the quota config xattr to newly added brick
    
    Issue:
    Quota directory limit configuration is stored in the xattrs. When a new brick
    is added these 'limit-set' xattrs have to be created to the directory in the
    new brick. This is done by the dht directory healing when the directory is
    created in the new brick. Since 'root' directory is already created DHT doesn't
    heal the limit-set xattr root.
    
    Solution:
    When the add-brick command is issued run the below hook script to heal the
    'limit-set' xattr. The hook script does the following only if limit is
    configured on root.
        1. Create an auxiliary mount.
        2. getxattr 'limit-set' on the root
        3. setxattr the same value on the root
    But this script needs the volume to be started to make the auxiliary mount.
    
    To handle the case when the add-brick is issued when the volume was stopped,
    symlink is created by the 'master' script to the corresponding location and
    these two are by default disabled.
    
    So, a 'master' script is added in the add-brick/pre. When add-brick command is
    issued, it enables one of the scripts mentioned above based on the condition,
        if volume is started - enable add-brick/post script
        else                 - enable start/post script
    After the actual script completes its job, it disables itself.
    
    Note:
    The enabling and disabling of the script is based on the glusterd's logic, that
    it only runs the scripts which starts its name with 'S'. So,
        Enable     - symlink the file to 'S'*
        Disable    - unlink the symlink.

    core: fix errno for non-existent GFID
    
    When clients refer to a GFID which does not exist, the errno to
    be returned in ESTALE (and not ENOENT). Even though ENOENT might
    look "proper" most of the time, as the application eventually expects
    ENOENT even if a parent directory does not exist, not returning
    ESTALE results in resolvers (FUSE and GFAPI) to not retry resolution
    in uncached mode. This can result in spurious ENOENTs during
    concurrent path modification operations.

    cluster/dht: instruct marker whenever it shouldn't do accounting
    
    This is needed for two reasons:
    
    * since dht-linkfiles are internal, they shouldn't be accounted.
    * hardlink handling in marker is broken. link/unlink of hardlinks
      present in same directory can break marker accounting. Hence, if src
      and dst are in same directory in case of rename, dht - if it breaks
      rename into link/unlink operations - should instruct marker to not to
      do accounting.

    features/quota: make writes short when the entire write cannot fit into available space.
    
    This patch aims to prevent creation of infinite zero byte sized files
    due to amount of storage available before exceeding quota limit
    being less than write sizes. Imagine x bytes of storage is available
    before we exceed quota limit and quota enforcer is receiving writes of
    size y and (y > x). In this scenario, if we run a shell script like:
    
       # for i in $(seq 1 10); do dd if=/dev/zero of=$i bs=y count=1; done
    
    Then, we would end up with 10 zero byte sized files, because we allow
    only complete writes and all writes will fail because of lack of space.
    However, creates succeed since a create itself will consume zero
    bytes. In this pattern of creates and writes, size of volume would
    never grow and x bytes of space will always be available and we can
    end up with an infinite number of zero byte sized files.

    features/quota: Improvements to quota
    
    * Two stages of quota enforcement is done:
    
      Soft and hard quota Upon reaching soft quota limit on the directory
      it logs/alerts in the quota daemon log (ie DEFAULT_LOG_DIR/quotad.log)
      and no more writes allowed after hard
      quota limit. After reaching the soft-limit the daemon alerts the
      user/admin repeatively for every 'alert-time', which is
      configurable.
    
    * Quota enforcer is moved to server-side.
    
      It  takes care of enforcing quota. Since enforcer doesn't have the
      cluster view, it relies on another service called
      quota-aggregator. Aggregator, on query can return the size of a
      directory based on the cluster view.
    
      Enforcer is always loaded in the server graph and is by passed if
      the feature is not enabled.
    
      Options specific to enforcer:
    
      server-quota - Specifies whether the feature is on/off. It is used
      to by pass the quota if turned off.
    
      deem-statfs - If set to on, it takes quota limits into consideration
      while estimating fs size. (df command). The algorithm followed is,
      i.   Adjust statvfs based on limit configured on root.
      ii.  If limit is set on the inode passed, use size/limits on that inode to
           populate statvfs. Otherwise, use size/limits configured on root.
      iii. Upon statvfs, update the ctx->size on the inode.
      iv.  Don't let DHT aggregate, instead take the maximum of the usages from the
           subvols of the DHT, since each of it contains the complete information.
    
      Enforcer also makes use of gfid-to-path conversion functionality to
      work correctly when a client like nfs predominently relies on
      nameless lookups.
    
    * Quota Aggregator acts as a thin client to provide cluster view
    
      Its a lightweight *gluster client* process with no mount point,
      started upon enabling quota or restarting the volume. This is a
      single process run on each brick, which can answer queries on all
      volumes in the cluster. Its volfile stored in
      GLUSTERD_DEFAULT_WORKING_DIR/quotad/quotad.vol.

        directory maintained in  the ".glusterfs" backend directory is
        read. The symlink handle is generated using the gfid of the
        directory. It (handle) contains the directory's name and parent
        gfid, which are used to recursively construct the absolute path as
        seen by the user from the mount point.
    
        A similar approach cannot be used for a regular file or a symbolic
        link since its hardlink handle, generated using its gfid, doesn't
        contain its parent gfid and basename. So xattrs are set to store
        the parent gfids and the number of hardlinks to a file or a
        symlink having the same parent gfid.  When an user/application
        requests for the paths of a regular file or a symlink with
        multiple hardlinks, using the parent gfids stored in the xattrs,
        the paths of the parent directories are generated as mentioned
        earlier. The base names of the hardlinks (with the same parent
        gfid) are determined by matching the actual backend inode numbers
        of each entry in the parent directory with that of the hardlink
        handle.
    
        Xattr is set on a regular file, link, and symbolic link as
        follows, Xattr name : trusted.pgfid.<pargfidstr> Xattr value :
        <number of hardlinks to a regular file/symlink with the same
        parentgfid>
    
        If a regular file, hard link, symbolic link is created then an
        xattr in the above format is set in the backend.
    
    how to use?
    ===========
        This functionality can be used through getxattr interface. Two
        keys - glusterfs.ancestry.dentry and glusterfs.ancestry.path - enable
        usage of this functionality. A successful getxattr will have the
        result stored under same keys. Values will be,
    
        glusterfs.ancestry.dentry:
        --------------------------
        A linked list of gf-dirent structures for all possible paths from
        root to this gfid. If there are multiple paths, the linked-list
        will be a series of paths one after another. Each path will be a
        series of dentries representing all components of the path. This
        key is primarily for internal usage within glusterfs.
    
        glusterfs.ancestry.path:
        ------------------------
        A string containing all possible paths from root to this gfid.
        Multiple hardlinks of a file or a symlink are displayed as a colon
        seperated list (this could interfere with path components
        containing ':').
    
        e.g. If there is a file "file1" in root directory with two hardlinks,
             "/dir2/link2tofile1" and "/dir1/link1tofile1", then
    
             [root@alpha gfsmntpt]# getfattr -n glusterfs.ancestry.path -e text
              file1
              glusterfs.ancestry.path="/file1:/dir2/link2tofile1:/dir1/link1tofile1"
    
        Thanks Amar, Avati and Venky for the inputs.

    cluster/afr: Provide HA for pathinfo getxattr
    
    Problem:
    afr_[f]getxattr_pathinfo_cbks fail the fop even when it succeeded on
    one of the bricks. This can happen if the last response to pathinfo
    [f]getxattr is a failure.
    
    Fix:
    Remember if any of the [f]getxattr_pathinfos are successful and send
    that as the op_ret/op_errno value to the xlators above.
    
    Note:
    Winding fop to a client xlator that is not connected to server produces
    an error log. Preventing that by not even winding fop when client xlator
    is DOWN.

    gNFS: More clean up for Gluster NFS
    
    1) Fix the typo in NFS default ACL
       The typo was introduced as part of the Fix to BZ 1009210 i.e.
       http://review.gluster.org/5980. The user ACL xattr structure
       was passed to default ACL xattr.
    
    2) Clean up NFS code to avoid unnecessary SEGV in
       rpcsvc_drc_reconfigure() which was not validating the
       svc->drc. Add a routine rpcsvc_drc_deinit() to handle
       the clean up of DRC specific data structures. For init(),
       use rpcsvc_drc_init().
    
    3) nfs_init_state() was returning wrong value even if the
       registration with portmapper failed, causing the NFS
       server process to hang around. As a result it used to
       get SEGV during rpcsvc_drc_reconfigure().
    
    4) Clean up memfactor usage across nfs.c nfs3.c.

    tests: add EXPECT_NOT macro
    
    We needed this macro while writing test cases for quota. With quota,
    a directory size is only guaranteed to be within some margin of quota
    limit, but not an accurate number. With not knowing what size to
    expect and EXPECT macro not complete enough to accept ranges of sizes,
    we can atleast write test-cases with EXPECT_NOT macro. After copying
    data to an empty file, it will be guaranteed the size will not be
    zero. This is good enough for quota test cases.

    glusterd: Start rebalance only where required
    
    Gluster was starting rebalance processes on peers where it wasn't
    required in two cases.
    - For a normal rebalance command on a volume, rebalance processes were
      started on all peers instead of just the peers which contain bricks of
      the volume
    - For rebalance process being restarted by a volume sync, caused by a
      new peer being probed or a peer restarting, rebalance processes were
      started on all peers, for both a normal rebalance and for remove-brick
      needing rebalance.
    
    This patch adds a new check before starting rebalance process in the
    above two cases.
    - For rebalance process required by a rebalance command, each peer will
      check if it contains atleast one brick of the volume
    - For rebalance process required by a remove-brick command, each peer
      will check if it contains atleast one of the bricks being removed

    Transparent data encryption and metadata authentication
    
    .. in the systems with non-trusted server
    
    This new functionality can be useful in various cloud technologies.
    It is implemented via a special encryption/crypt translator,which
    works on the client side and performs encryption and authentication;
    
                  1. Class of supported algorithms
    
    The crypt translator can support any atomic symmetric block cipher
    algorithms (which require to pad plain/cipher text before performing
    encryption/decryption transform (see glossary in atom.c for
    definitions). In particular, it can support algorithms with the EOF
    issue (which require to pad the end of file by extra-data).
    
    Crypt translator performs translations
    user -> (offset, size) -> (aligned-offset, padded-size) ->server
    (and backward), and resolves individual FOPs (write(), truncate(),
    etc) to read-modify-write sequences.
    
    A volume can contain files encrypted by different algorithms of the
    mentioned class. To change some option value just reconfigure the
    volume.
    
    Currently only one algorithm is supported: AES_XTS.
    
    Example of algorithms, which can not be supported by the crypt
    translator:
    
    1. Asymmetric block cipher algorithms, which inflate data, e.g. RSA;
    2. Symmetric block cipher algorithms with inline MACs for data
       authentication.
    
                       2. Implementation notes.
    
    a) Atomic algorithms
    
    Since any process in a stackable file system manipulates with local
    data (which can be obsoleted by local data of another process), any
    atomic cipher algorithm without proper support can lead to non-POSIX
    behavior. To resolve the "collisions" we introduce locks: before
    performing FOP->read(), FOP->write(), etc. the process should first
    lock the file.
    
    b) Algorithms with EOF issue
    
    Such algorithms require to pad the end of file with some extra-data.
    Without proper support this will result in losing information about
    real file size. Keeping a track of real file size is a responsibility
    of the crypt translator. A special extended attribute with the name
    "trusted.glusterfs.crypt.att.size" is used for this purpose. All files
    contained in bricks of encrypted volume do have "padded" sizes.
    
                      3. Non-trusted servers and
                         Metadata authentication
    
    We assume that server, where user's data is stored on is non-trusted.
    It means that the server can be subjected to various attacks directed
    to reveal user's encrypted personal data. We provide protection
    against such attacks.
    
    Every encrypted file has specific private attributes (cipher algorithm
    id, atom size, etc), which are packed to a string (so-called "format
    string") and stored as a special extended attribute with the name
    "trusted.glusterfs.crypt.att.cfmt". We protect the string from
    tampering. This protection is mandatory, hardcoded and is always on.
    Without such protection various attacks (based on extending the scope
    of per-file secret keys) are possible.
    
    Our authentication method has been developed in tight collaboration
    with Red Hat security team and is implemented as "metadata loader of
    version 1" (see file metadata.c). This method is NIST-compliant and is
    based on checking 8-byte per-hardlink MACs created(updated) by
    FOP->create(), FOP->link(), FOP->unlink(), FOP->rename() by the
    following unique entities:
    
    . file (hardlink) name;
    . verified file's object id (gfid).
    
    Every time, before manipulating with a file, we check it's MACs at
    FOP->open() time. Some FOPs don't require a file to be opened (e.g.
    FOP->truncate()). In such cases the crypt translator opens the file
    mandatory.
    
                            4. Generating keys
    
    Unique per-file keys are derived by NIST-compliant methods from the
    
    a) parent key;
    b) unique verified object-id of the file (gfid);
    Per-volume master key, provided by user at mount time is in the root
    of this "tree of keys".
    
    Those keys are used to:
    
    1) encrypt/decrypt file data;
    2) encrypt/decrypt file metadata;
    3) create per-file and per-link MACs for metadata authentication.
    
                              5. Instructions
                     Getting started with crypt translator
    
    Example:
    
    1) Create a volume "myvol" and enable encryption:
    
       # gluster volume create myvol pepelac:/vols/xvol
       # gluster volume set myvol encryption on
    
    2) Set location (absolute pathname) of your master key:
    
       # gluster volume set myvol encryption.master-key /home/me/mykey
    
    3) Set other options to override default options, if needed.
       Start the volume.
    
    4) On the client side make sure that the file /home/me/mykey exists
       and contains proper per-volume master key (that is 256-bit AES
       key). This key has to be in hex form, i.e. should be represented
       by 64 symbols from the set  {'0', ..., '9', 'a', ..., 'f'}.
       The key should start at the beginning of the file. All symbols at
       offsets >= 64 are ignored.
    
    5) Mount the volume "myvol" on the client side:
    
       # glusterfs --volfile-server=pepelac --volfile-id=myvol /mnt
    
       After successful mount the file which contains master key may be
       removed. NOTE: Keeping the master key between mount sessions is in
       user's competence.
    
    **********************************************************************
    
    WARNING! Losing the master key will make content of all regular files
    inaccessible. Mount with improper master key allows to access content
    of directories: file names are not encrypted.
    
    **********************************************************************
    
                   6. Options of crypt translator
    
    1) "master-key": specifies location (absolute pathname) of the file
       which contains per-volume master key. There is no default location
       for master key.
    
    2) "data-key-size": specifies size of per-file key for data encryption
       Possible values:
       . "256" default value
       . "512"
    
    3) "block-size": specifies atom size. Possible values:
       . "512"
       . "1024"
       . "2048"
       . "4096" default value;
    
                           7. Test cases
    
    Any workload, which involves the following file operations:
    
    ->create();
    ->open();
    ->readv();
    ->writev();
    ->truncate();
    ->ftruncate();
    ->link();
    ->unlink();
    ->rename();
    ->readdirp().
    
                            8. TODOs:
    
    1) Currently size of IOs issued by crypt translator is restricted
       by block_size (4K by default). We can use larger IOs to improve
       performance.

    bd: Add support to create clone, snapshot and merge of LV images.
    
    Special xattr names "clone" & "snapshot" can be used to create full and
    linked clone of the LV images. GFID of destination posix file (to be
    mapped) is passed as a value to the xattr. Destination posix file must
    exist before running this operation.
    
    These operations form a basis for offloading storage related operations
    from QEMU to GlusterFS.
    
    Syntax for full clone: xattr name: "clone" value: "gfid-of-dest-file"
    Syntax for linked clone: xattr name: "snapshot" value: "gfid-of-dest-file"
    Syntax for merging: xattr name: "merge" value: "path-to-snapshot-file"
    
    Example:
    	setfattr -n clone -v <gfid-of-dest-file> /media/source
    	setfattr -n snapshot -v <gfid-of-dest-file> /media/source
    	setfattr -n merge -v "/media/sn" /media/sn

    bd: posix/multi-brick support to BD xlator
    
    Current BD xlator (block backend) has a few limitations such as
    * Creation of directories not supported
    * Supports only single brick
    * Does not use extended attributes (and client gfid) like posix xlator
    * Creation of special files (symbolic links, device nodes etc) not
      supported
    
    Basic limitation of not allowing directory creation is blocking
    oVirt/VDSM to consume BD xlator as part of Gluster domain since VDSM
    creates multi-level directories when GlusterFS is used as storage
    backend for storing VM images.
    
    To overcome these limitations a new BD xlator with following
    improvements is suggested.
    
    * New hybrid BD xlator that handles both regular files and block device
      files
    * The volume will have both POSIX and BD bricks. Regular files are
      created on POSIX bricks, block devices are created on the BD brick (VG)
    * BD xlator leverages exiting POSIX xlator for most POSIX calls and
      hence sits above the POSIX xlator
    * Block device file is differentiated from regular file by an extended
      attribute
    * The xattr 'user.glusterfs.bd' (BD_XATTR) plays a role in mapping a
      posix file to Logical Volume (LV).
    * When a client sends a request to set BD_XATTR on a posix file, a new
      LV is created and mapped to posix file. So every block device will
      have a representative file in POSIX brick with 'user.glusterfs.bd'
      (BD_XATTR) set.
    * Here after all operations on this file results in LV related
      operations.
    
    For example opening a file that has BD_XATTR set results in opening
    the LV block device, reading results in reading the corresponding LV
    block device.
    
    When BD xlator gets request to set BD_XATTR via setxattr call, it
    creates a LV and information about this LV is placed in the xattr of the
    posix file. xattr "user.glusterfs.bd" used to identify that posix file
    is mapped to BD.
    
    Usage:
    Server side:
    [root@host1 ~]# gluster volume create bdvol host1:/storage/vg1_info?vg1 host2:/storage/vg2_info?vg2
    It creates a distributed gluster volume 'bdvol' with Volume Group vg1
    using posix brick /storage/vg1_info in host1 and Volume Group vg2 using
    /storage/vg2_info in host2.
    
    [root@host1 ~]# gluster volume start bdvol
    
    Client side:
    [root@node ~]# mount -t glusterfs host1:/bdvol /media
    [root@node ~]# touch /media/posix
    It creates regular posix file 'posix' in either host1:/vg1 or host2:/vg2 brick
    [root@node ~]# mkdir /media/image
    [root@node ~]# touch /media/image/lv1
    It also creates regular posix file 'lv1' in either host1:/vg1 or
    host2:/vg2 brick
    [root@node ~]# setfattr -n "user.glusterfs.bd" -v "lv" /media/image/lv1
    [root@node ~]#
    Above setxattr results in creating a new LV in corresponding brick's VG
    and it sets 'user.glusterfs.bd' with value 'lv:<default-extent-size'
    [root@node ~]# truncate -s5G /media/image/lv1
    It results in resizig LV 'lv1'to 5G
    
    New BD xlator code is placed in xlators/storage/bd directory.
    
    Also add volume-uuid to the VG so that same VG can't be used for other
    bricks/volumes. After deleting a gluster volume, one has to manually
    remove the associated tag using vgchange <vg-name> --deltag
    <trusted.glusterfs.volume-id:<volume-id>>
    
    Changes from previous version V5:
    * Removed support for delayed deleting of LVs
    
    Changes from previous version V4:
    * Consolidated the patches
    * Removed usage of BD_XATTR_SIZE and consolidated it in BD_XATTR.
    
    Changes from previous version V3:
    * Added support in FUSE to support full/linked clone
    * Added support to merge snapshots and provide information about origin
    * bd_map xlator removed
    * iatt structure used in inode_ctx. iatt is cached and updated during
    fsync/flush
    * aio support
    * Type and capabilities of volume are exported through getxattr
    
    Changes from version 2:
    * Used inode_context for caching BD size and to check if loc/fd is BD or
      not.
    * Added GlusterFS server offloaded copy and snapshot through setfattr
      FOP. As part of this libgfapi is modified.
    * BD xlator supports stripe
    * During unlinking if a LV file is already opened, its added to delete
      list and bd_del_thread tries to delete from this list when a last
      reference to that file is closed.
    
    Changes from previous version:
    * gfid is used as name of LV
    * ? is used to specify VG name for creating BD volume in volume
      create, add-brick. gluster volume create volname host:/path?vg
    * open-behind issue is fixed
    * A replicate brick can be added dynamically and LVs from source brick
      are replicated to destination brick
    * A distribute brick can be added dynamically and rebalance operation
      distributes existing LVs/files to the new brick
    * Thin provisioning support added.
    * bd_map xlator support retained
    * setfattr -n user.glusterfs.bd -v "lv" creates a regular LV and
      setfattr -n user.glusterfs.bd -v "thin" creates thin LV
    * Capability and backend information added to gluster volume info (and
    --xml) so
      that management tools can exploit BD xlator.
    * tracing support for bd xlator added
    
    TODO:
    * Add support to display snapshots for a given LV
    * Display posix filename for list-origin instead of gfid

    features/compress: Compression/DeCompression translator
    
    * When a writev call occurs, the client compresses the data before
      sending it to server. On the server, compressed data is decompressed.
      Similarly, when a readv call occurs, the server compresses the data
      before sending it to client. On the client, the compressed data is
      decompressed. Thus the amount of data sent over the wire is minimized.
    
    * Compression/Decompression is done using Zlib library.
    
    * During normal operation, this is the format of data sent over wire :
      <compressed-data> + trailer(8)
      The trailer contains the CRC32 checksum and length of original
      uncompressed data. This is used for validation.
    
    HOW TO USE
    ----------
    Turning on compression xlator:
    gluster volume set <vol_name> compress on
    
    Configurable options:
    gluster volume set <vol_name> compress.compression-level 8
    gluster volume set <vol_name> compress.min-size 50

    features/qemu-block: simplify coroutine model to use single synctask, ucontext
    
    The current coroutine model, mapping synctasks 1-1 with qemu internal
    Coroutines, has some unresolved raciness issues. This problem usually
    manifests as lifecycle mismatches between top-level (gluster created)
    synctasks and the subsequently created internal coroutines from that
    context. Qemu's internal queueing (and locking) can cause situations
    where the top-level synctask is destroyed before the internal scheduler
    has released references to memory, leading to use after free crashes
    and asserts.
    
    Simplify the coroutine model to use a single synctask as a coroutine
    processor and rely on the existing native ucontext coroutine
    implementation. The syncenv thread is donated to qemu and ensures a
    single top-level coroutine is processed at a time. Qemu now has
    complete control over coroutine scheduling.

    features/qemu-block: add qemu backing image support (clone)
    
    Add basic backing image support to the block-format mechanism. This
    is a functionality checkpoint that enables the raw mechanism
    required to support client driven "snapshot" and "clone" requests.
    
    This change enhances the block-format setxattr command to support
    an additional and optional backing image reference. For example:
    
    setxattr -n trusted.glusterfs.block-format -v "qcow2:10GB:<bimg>" ./newimage
    
    ... where <bimg> refers to the backing image for unallocated blocks
    in newimage. <bimg> can be provided in one of two formats:
    
    - a gfid string in the following format (assuming a valid gfid):
    
    <gfid:00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000>
    
    - or a filename that must be resident in the same directory as the
    new clone file being formatted. E.g.,
    
    setxattr -n trusted.glusterfs.block-format -v "qcow2:10GB:baseimg" ./newimage
    
    This latter format is more restrictive, simply provided for
    convenience or until something more refined is available.
    
    This change makes no assumptions about the backing image file and
    affords no additional protection. It is up to the user/client to
    recognize the relationship between the files and manage them
    appropriately (i.e., no writes to the backing image, etc.).

    glusterfs: zerofill support
    
    Add support for a new ZEROFILL fop. Zerofill writes zeroes to a file in
    the specified range. This fop will be useful when a whole file needs to
    be initialized with zero (could be useful for zero filled VM disk image
    provisioning or  during scrubbing of VM disk images).
    
    Client/application can issue this FOP for zeroing out. Gluster server
    will zero out required range of bytes ie server offloaded zeroing. In
    the absence of this fop,  client/application has to repetitively issue
    write (zero) fop to the server, which is very inefficient method because
    of the overheads involved in RPC calls  and acknowledgements.
    
    WRITESAME is a  SCSI T10 command that takes a block of data as input and
    writes the same data to other blocks and this write is handled
    completely within the storage and hence is known as offload . Linux ,now
    has support for SCSI WRITESAME command which is exposed to the user in
    the form of BLKZEROOUT ioctl.  BD Xlator can exploit BLKZEROOUT ioctl to
    implement this fop. Thus zeroing out operations can be completely
    offloaded to the storage device , making it highly efficient.
    
    The fop takes two arguments offset and size. It zeroes out 'size' number
    of bytes in an opened file starting from 'offset' position.
    
    This patch adds zerofill support to the following areas:
    	- libglusterfs
    	- io-stats
    	- performance/md-cache,open-behind
    	- quota
    	- cluster/afr,dht,stripe
    	- rpc/xdr
    	- protocol/client,server
    	- io-threads
    	- marker
    	- storage/posix
    	- libgfapi
    
    Client applications can exloit this fop by using glfs_zerofill introduced in
    libgfapi.FUSE support to this fop has not been added as there is no system call
    for this fop.
    
    Changes from previous version 3:
    * Removed redundant memory failure log messages
    
    Changes from previous version 2:
    * Rebased and fixed build error
    
    Changes from previous version 1:
    * Rebased for latest master
    
    TODO :
         * Add zerofill support to trace xlator
         * Expose zerofill capability as part of gluster volume info
    
    Here is a performance comparison of server offloaded zeofill vs zeroing
    out using repeated writes.

    gfapi: remove unnecessary call to glfs_resolve_base()
    
    Calling glfs_resolve_base() on the root inode for every resolver
    invocation is unnecessary and wasteful.

    glusterd: modify remove-brick CLI message.
    
    In the current context "replica_cnt" is used just to know whether the
    specific key exists or not by calling "dict_get_int32", which we can
    replace by "dict_get ()". And changing the log message as it is more
    appropriate to say "migration of data" rather than "rebalance".

    Problem:
    nfs3_stat_to_fattr3() missed a NULL check.
    
    FIX:
    (1) Added a NULL check.
    (2) In all fop cbk path, if the op_ret is -1 and op_errno is 0,
        then handle it as a special case. Set the NFS3 status as
        NFS3ERR_SERVERFAULT instead of NFS3_OK.
    (3) The other component of FIX would be in DHT module and
        is on the way.

    mgmt/glusterd: add option to specify a different base-port
    
    This is (arguably) a hack to work around a bug in libvirt which is not
    well behaved wrt to using TCP ports in the unreserved space between
    49152-65535. (See RFC 6335)
    
    Normally glusterd starts and binds to the first available port in range,
    usually 49152. libvirt's live migration also tries to use ports in this
    range, but has no fallback to use (an)other port(s) when the one it wants
    is already in use.

    2. Both protected and unprotected fields are reset.

    cli,glusterd: Changes to cli-glusterd communication
    
    Glusterd changes:
    With this patch, glusterd creates a socket file in
    DATADIR/run/glusterd.socket , and listen on it for cli requests. It
    listens for 2 rpc programs on the socket file,
    - The glusterd cli rpc program, for all cli commands
    - A reduced glusterd handshake program, just for the 'system:: getspec'
      command
    
    The location of the socket file can be changed with the glusterd option
    'glusterd-sockfile'.
    
    To retain compatibility with the '--remote-host' cli option, glusterd
    also listens for the cli requests on port 24007. But, for the sake of
    security, it listens using a reduced cli rpc program on the port. The
    reduced rpc program only contains read-only procs used for 'volume
    (info|list|status)', 'peer status' and 'system:: getwd' cli commands.
    
    CLI changes:
    The gluster cli now uses the glusterd socket file for communicating with
    glusterd by default. A new option '--gluster-sock' has been added to
    allow specifying the sockfile used to connect. Using the '--remote-host'
    option will make cli connect to the given host & port.
    
    Tests changes:
    cluster.rc has been modified to make use of socket files and use
    different log files for each glusterd.
    Some of the tests using cluster.rc have been fixed.

    dht: dht_lookup_dir_cbk should set op_errno as local->op_errno
    
    Two glusterfs clients return inconsistent errnos when the bricks of the volume
    were down. Consider two gluster mounts. Mount 1 was done when the bricks were
    online. Mount 2 was done after the bricks were killed, (using the 'glusterfs'
    command instead of the mount script).
    
    For any request, mount 1 will return ENOTCONN, where as mount 2 will return
    ENOENT.
    
    This happens because for the 2nd mount, a fuse would send a lookup on '/' for
    any request, as it hadn't been done yet. The client xlator returns ENOTCONN,
    but the dht_lookup_dir_cbk changed this to ENOENT unconditionally when
    aggregating. So, fuse returned ENOENT, even though the errno should have been
    ENOTCONN.

    libglusterfs: Add monotonic clocking counter for timer thread
    
    gettimeofday() returns the current wall clock time and timezone.
    Using these functions in order to measure the passage of time
    (how long an operation took) therefore seems like a no-brainer.
    
    This time suffer's from some limitations:
    
    a. They have a low resolution: “High-performance” timing by
    definition, requires clock resolutions into the microseconds
    or better.
    
    b. They can jump forwards and backwards in time: Computer
    clocks all tick at slightly different rates, which causes
    the time to drift. Most systems have NTP enabled which
    periodically adjusts the system clock to keep them in sync
    with “actual” time. The adjustment can cause the clock to
    suddenly jump forward (artificially inflating your timing
    numbers) or jump backwards (causing your timing calculations
    to go negative or hugely positive). In such cases timer
    thread could go into an infinite loop.
    
    From 'man gettimeofday':
    ----------
    ..
    ..
    The time returned by gettimeofday() is affected by discontinuous
    jumps in the system time (e.g., if the system administrator manually
    changes the system time).  If you need a monotonically increasing
    clock, see clock_gettime(2).
    ..
    ..
    ----------
    
    Rationale:
    
    For calculating interval timing for Timer thread, all that’s
    needed should be clock as a simple counter that increments
    at a stable rate.
    
    This is necessary to avoid the jumps which are caused by using
    "wall time", this counter must be monotonic that can never
    “tick” backwards, ever.

    cluster/afr: [Feature] Command implementation to get heal-count
    
    Currently to know the number of files to be healed, either user
    has to go to backend and check the number of entries present in
    indices/xattrop directory. But if a volume consists of large
    number of bricks, going to each backend and counting the number
    of entries is a time-taking task. Otherwise user can give
    gluster volume heal vol-name info command but with this
    approach if no. of entries are very hugh in the indices/
    xattrop directory, it will comsume time.
    
    So as a feature, new command is implemented.
    
    Command 1: gluster volume heal vn statistics heal-count
    This command will get the number of entries present in
    every brick of a volume. The output displays only entries
    count.
    
    Command 2: gluster volume heal vn statistics heal-count
               replica 192.168.122.1:/home/user/brickname
    
               Here if we are concerned with just one replica.
    So providing any one of the brick of a replica will get
    the number of entries to be healed for that replica only.
    
    Example:
    Replicate volume with replica count 2.
    
    Backend status:
    --------------
    [root@dhcp-0-17 xattrop]# ls -lia | wc -l
    1918
    
    NOTE: Out of 1918, 2 entries are <xattrop-gfid> dummy
    entries so actual no. of entries to be healed are
    1916.
    
    [root@dhcp-0-17 xattrop]# pwd
    /home/user/2ty/.glusterfs/indices/xattrop
    
    Command output:
    --------------
    Gathering count of entries to be healed on volume volume3 has been successful
    
    Brick 192.168.122.1:/home/user/22iu
    Status: Brick is Not connected

    "gluster volume heal volumename statistics" command gives the summary
    of the afr crawl done based on the entries present in the xattrop
    directory. Whenever afr crawls are attempted, the beginning time of
    crawl, end time of crawl, no of files healed, heal-failed count and
    number of files in split brain are shown along with the type of the
    crawl. If crawl is already in progress then it will give the number
    of files healed, heal failed count and number of files in split-brain
    from the beginning of the crawl and instead of telling the end time of
    the crawl, "CRAWL IN PROGRESS" message will be shown.

    gfapi: object handle based API extensions
    
    There is an ongoing effort to integrate NFS Ganesha (
    https://github.com/nfs-ganesha/nfs-ganesha/wiki ) with GlusterFS as one of
    the file system back ends.
    
    Towards this we need extensions to gfapi that can handle object based
    operations. Meaning, instead of using full paths or relative paths from
    cwd, it is required that we can work with APIs, like the *at POSIX
    variants, to be able to create, lookup, open etc. files and directories.
    Hence the objects are the files or directories themselves and we give out
    handles to these objects that can be used for further operations.
    
    This code drop is an initial implementation of the proposed APIs.
    
    The new APIs are implemented as glfs_h_XXX variants in the file
    glfs-handleops.c to mirror glfs-fops.c style. The code leverages holding
    onto inode references and doling these out as opaque/cookie type objects to
    the callers, to enable them to be used as handles in other operations.
    
    An fd based approach was considered, but due to the extra footprint that
    the fd structure and its counterparts would incur, this was dropped to take
    the approach of holding inode references themselves.
    
    Tested by extending glfsxmp.c to invoke and exercise the added APIs, and
    further tested with a reference integration of the same as an FSAL with NFS
    Ganesha.

    cluster/afr: Handle quota size xattr separately in lookup
    
    Quota size xattrs are not maintained by afr. There is a
    possibility that they differ even when both the directory
    changelog xattrs suggest everything is fine. So if there is at
    least one 'source' check among the sources which has the maximum
    quota size. Otherwise check among all the available ones for
    maximum quota size. This way if there is a source and stale copies
    it always votes for the 'source'.

    Coroutine caching in qemu is dangerous in the manner that the
    qemu-block translator embeds the qemu block subsystem code. After
    a graph switch, new requests can fork off and pass active graph
    data structures (i.e., inodes) down into old syncenvs and old

    oVirt's Gluster Integration needs an inexpensive command that can be
    executed every 10 seconds to monitor async tasks and their parameters,

    The solution involves adding a 'tasks' sub-command to 'volume status'
    to fetch only the async task IDs, type and other relevant parameters.
    Only the originator glusterd participates in this command as all the
    information needed is available on all the nodes. This is to make the
    command suitable for being executed every 10 seconds.

    NFS: showmount timesout on fetching export list
    
    Bug: 1015184
    
    Issue:  showmount timesout on fetching export list. Socket writev
            function is failing.
    Cause:  XDR encoding of export list is failing. The calling function
            without checking the error returned by xdr_serialize_exports
            function is going ahead and writting into the socket causing
            the NFS process to hang. xdr_serialize_exports function returns
            -1 on error and message length on success.
    Fix:    Caller should check if the function is returning -1 (error) or
            not before proceeding.

    geo-rep: logrotate: Logrotate handling
    
    In existing georep logrotate was implemented by handling SIGSTOP
    and SIGCONT, gsyncd was failing to start again after SIGSTOP.
    New approach uses WatchedFileHandler in logging, which tracks the
    log file changes or logrotate. Reopens the log file if logrotate is
    triggered or if same log file is updated from other process.
    
    As per python doc:
    http://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.handlers.html:
    The WatchedFileHandler class, located in the logging.handlers module,
    is a FileHandler which watches the file it is logging to. If the file
    changes, it is closed and reopened using the file name.
    
    A file change can happen because of usage of programs such as newsyslog
    and logrotate which perform log file rotation. This handler, intended
    for use under Unix/Linux, watches the file to see if it has changed
    since the last emit. (A file is deemed to have changed if its device
    or inode have changed.) If the file has changed, the old file stream
    is closed, and the file opened to get a new stream.

    protocol/server: eliminate an unnecessary frame create and destroy
    
    connection_cleanup creates a frame solely so that it can be copied.
    
    But the process of copying creates a new frame, and there's nothing
    apparently magic about the one being copied; we can eliminate an
    unnecessary create and destroy.
    
    Which in the grand scheme of things probably isn't the worst thing
    we do, but it's low hanging fruit.

    the library into the Python site-packages path. Python applications and

    glusterd: Calculate volume op-versions only on set/reset
    
    The volume op-versions are calculated during a volume set/reset, reading a
    volume from disk and importing a volume during probe or volume sync. The
    calculation of the volume op-version depends on the clusters op-version as some
    features are enabled automatically depending on the clusters op-version. We
    also don't store the volume op-versions persistently and don't export the
    volume op-versions during sync. Due to this, there can occur cases which will
    lead to inconsistencies in volumes in different peers. One such case is below,
    
    Consider, a cluster made up 3 peers P1, P2 and P3, operating at op-version N.
    The cluster has two volumes V1 and V2, which have volume op-versions N (since
    volume op-version cannot be greater than cluster op-version). We have,
     Cluster-op-version = N
     V1 op-version = N
     V2 op-version = N
    A set operation on V1 causes the clusters op-version to be bumped up to N+1.
    Assume that there exist some features that are automatically enabled on
    op-version N+1. The op-version of V2 remains at N as no operation has been
    performed on it. So,
     Cluster op-version = N+1
     V1 op-version = N+1
     V2 op-version = N
    Now, we probe a new peer P4. On the new peer we will have the following
    op-versions,
     Cluster op-version = N+1
     V1 op-version = N+1
     V2 op-version = N+1
    This happens because we don't send volume op-versions during the sync after
    probe. P4 will freshly calculate the op-version of V2 (assuming features have
    been auto enabled due to the cluster op-version being N+1) as N+1.
    
    Another case is when glusterd on a peer restarts. Assume P3 was restarted,
    glusterd will recalculate the volume op-versions during the restore state.
    Again, op-version of V2 will be calculated as N+1 assuming auto enabled
    features. This will lead to inconsistency in the volume representation in
    memory and on disk, as glusterd will assume the volume contains auto enabled
    features, but the volfiles don't contain them as they were not regenrated.
    
    These kind of issues can be solved by calculating the volume op-version only
    when features are enabled and disabled (ie. during volume set/reset),
    persisting the volume-op-versions and exporting/importing them.

    glusterd: Fix storing volumes on setting global opts
    
    Glusterd would not store all the volumes when a global options were set.
    When setting a global option, like 'nfs.*' options, glusterd used to
    modify the volinfo for all the volumes, but would store only the volinfo
    for the named volume. This lead to mismatch in the persisted and the
    in-memory representation of those volumes, which lead to problems like
    peers being rejected because of volume mismatches.

    gNFS: Incorrect NFS ACL encoding for XFS
    
    Problem:
    Incorrect NFS ACL encoding causes "system.posix_acl_default"
    setxattr failure on bricks on XFS file system. XFS (potentially
    others?) doesn't understand when the 0x10 prefix is added to the
    ACL type field for default ACLs (which the Linux NFS client adds)
    which causes setfacl()->setxattr() to fail silently. NFS client
    adds NFS_ACL_DEFAULT(0x1000) for default ACL.
    
    FIX:
    Mask the prefix (added by NFS client) OFF, so the setfacl is not
    rejected when it hits the FS.

    Typically when updating cached ACL from backend, we get both iatt and
    ACL xattrs (like lookup, readdirplus etc.) However in calls like
    setattr(), the mode would have updated but we receive only iatt and not
    the ACL xattrs. In such case we need to "spread" the effects of the
    changed mode properly into the cached ACL xattr ourselves.

    We cannot heal in dht_discover, as it is a gfid based lookup, and not

    glusterd.service (systemd), ensure glusterd starts before local mounts
    
    NOTICE: this patch was accepted onto the release-3.4 branch for 3.4.1,
    but this same patch for master is languishing here in review.
    
    Try (emphasis on the try) to ensure that glusterd starts, and in turn
    starts glusterfsd before init attempt to mount any gluster (or gluster
    NFS) volumes in /etc/fstab.
    
    N.B. Joe Julian says this doesn't fix the problem for him, although it
    worked for me in kvm. Lennart Poettering says it should, and we should
    file a BZ against systemd if it doesn't. See

    glusterd: Adding transaction checks for cluster unlock.
    
    While a gluster command holding lock is in execution,
    any other gluster command which tries to run will fail to
    acquire the lock. As a result command#2 will follow the
    cleanup code flow, which also includes unlocking the held
    locks. As both the commands are run from the same node,
    command#2 will end up releasing the locks held by command#1
    even before command#1 reaches completion.
    
    Now we call the unlock routine in the code path, of the cluster
    has been locked during the same transaction.

    gNFS: NFS daemon is limiting IOs to 64KB
    
    Problem:
    Gluster NFS server is hard-coding the max rsize/wsize to 64KB
    which is very less for NFS running over 10GE NIC. The existing
    options nfs.read-size, nfs.write-size are not working as
    expected.
    
    FIX:
    Make the options nfs.read-size (for rsize) and nfs.write-size
    (for wsize) work to tune the NFS I/O size. Value range would
    be 4KB(Min)-64KB(Default)-1MB(max).
    
    NB: Credit to "Richard Wareing" for catching it.

    distribute: Rebalance should provide even disk space distribution
    
    Earlier disk space check had an issue which didn't
    provide the needed functionality to avoid migration
    when the destination had lesser available space,
    scenario we need to avoid is stated below :
    
    During rebalance `migrate-data` - Destination subvol experiences
    a `reduction` in 'blocks' of free space, at the same time source
    subvol gains certain 'blocks' of free space. A valid check is
    necessary here to avoid errorneous move to destination where
    the space could be scantily available.
    
    This patch provides a proper fix in place by subtracting
    necessary file blocks from destination and adding those blocks
    to source.

    glusterd: Don't reset rebalance status on add-brick
    
    The rebalance status was being reset to 'Not started' when add-brick was
    performed. This would lead to odd cases where a 'rebalance status' on a
    volume would show status as 'not started' but would also include the
    rebalance statistics. This also affected the showing of asynchronus task
    status in 'volume status' command.
    
    By not resetting the status prevent the above issues from happening.
    Since we use the running/not-running of the rebalance process as the
    check when performing other operations we can safely leave the rebalance
    stats collected on an add-brick.

    This reverts commit 215fea41a96479312a5ab8783c13b30ab9fe00fa
    
    Realized soon after merging, that this patch is actually useless.
    Checking for inode utilization on dst relative to src is of no use
    because dst is already storing linkfile and inode is already consumed
    no matter what. We might as well perform the rebalance and save on an
    inode on the src node.

    cluster/distribute: Rebalance should also verify free inodes
    
    Currently during `MIGRATE_DATA` we never verified about the total
    inode usage among new and old bricks. Such checks are available for
    disk space usage but it is also needed for inodes during data
    migration. Such a check leads to uniform outcome of file distribution
    upon rebalance.
    
    Patch provides:
    
    - Check dst_inodes < src_inodes, a friendly `warning` message to
      indicate we have to ignore such an attempt
    - Rename __dht_check_free_space() --> __dht_check_free_space_and_inodes()

    rpcsvc: allocate large auxgid list on demand
    
    For rpc requests having large aux group list, allocate large list
    on demand. Else use small static array by default.
    
    Without this patch, glusterfsd allocates 140+MB of resident memory
    just to get started and initialized.

    qemu-block: fix building from distribution tarball when glib2-devel is installed
    
    Building RPMs from a 'make dist' tarball fails when qemu-block is
    enabled. Enabling is done automatically when the glib2 development files
    are available (enabled by ./configure).
    
    Manual building with:
    
      $ ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make dist && rpmbuild -ta *.tar.gz
    
    Building in mock works fine, glib2-devel is not installed by default so
    the qemu-block xlator gets disabled. This change also adds glib2-devel
    to the BuildRequires in the glusterfs.spec file, causing the qemu-block
    xlator to be built by default, and included in the glusterfs RPM.

    When running multiple mock builds at the same time, the space
    requirements under /var/tmp increases as well. Not all systems (like
    build.gluster.org) have enough free space in /var/tmp to host two
    mock-roots, which causes building to fail randomly.

    rpc/rpc-lib: rpcsvc should reply when rpc_err is set
    
    Problem:
    When requests are received on a connection before setvolume
    is done, creating frame from the requests fail because there is
    no association of the transport with the conn(i.e. xl_private).
    xl_private is set only on set_volume. In such cases error response
    is not sent from server xlator to that request because of which
    operations on mount point are hanging.
    
    Fix:
    Set actor return value to RPCSVC_ACTOR_ERROR so that response is sent
    even in these cases.

    glusterd: Allow bumping down a peer's op-version during probe
    
    Earlier, a peer running a higher op-version couldn't be probed into a
    cluster running at a lower op-version. This created issues when trying
    to expand an upgraded cluster. This patch changes this behaviour.
    
    The cluster no longer rejects a peer being probed if its op-version is
    higher than the cluster op-version. The peer will reduce its op-version
    if it doesn't have any volumes. If the peer contains volumes and needs
    to reduce its op-version, it fails the handshake and the probe fails.

    or when self-healing a half-done mkdir(), the layout assignment split
    must happen based on the final number of directories, and not the
    currently existing number of directories (because we finish mkdir()
    of missing directories before hash layout assignment).
    
    Without this fix, concurrent mkdir() and lookup() will step on
    each others feet, create a messed up layout on disk, and end up
    with different in-memory layouts.
    
    Once two clients have different in-memory layouts, creation of
    subdirectory will not arbitrate on the same hashed subvolume and will
    result in GFID mismatch of the sub-directory.

    rpm: fix "warning: File listed twice: .../glusterd.info"
    
    Commit a482e422 added glusterd.info to the %files section of the
    glusterfs-server package. However, this file was listed already. This
    causes the following warning when building the RPMs:
    
        warning: File listed twice: /var/lib/glusterd/glusterd.info
    
    Merging the attributes for /var/lib/glusterd/glusterd.info into one line
    prevents this warning.

    parser: make the parser thread safe.
    
    The volfile parser thread safe by guarding the parsing phase
    in a mutex. Thread safety becomes a problem when there are multiple
    glfs_t objects created by gfapi and all of them potentially parse
    the respective volfiles at the same time.

    glusterfsd: Round robin DNS should not be relied upon with
    config service availability for clients.
    
    Backupvolfile server as it stands is slow and prone to errors
    with mount script and its combination with RRDNS. Instead in
    theory it should use all the available nodes in 'trusted pool'
    by default (Right now we don't have a mechanism in place for
    this)
    
    Nevertheless this patch provides a scenario where a list of
    volfile-server can be provided on command as shown below
    
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    $ glusterfs -s server1 .. -s serverN --volfile-id=<volname> \
          <mount_point>
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
                       OR
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    $ mount -t glusterfs -obackup-volfile-servers=<server2>: \
          <server3>:...:<serverN> <server1>:/<volname> <mount_point>
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Here ':' is used as a separator for mount script parsing
    
    Now these will be remembered and recursively attempted for
    fetching vol-file until exhausted. This would ensure that the
    clients get 'volume' configs in a consistent manner avoiding the
    need to poll through RRDNS.

    glusterfs, gfapi: fix symbol clash
    
    The callback structures in both protocol/client and glusterfsd,
    gfapi used the same name for the actor table - gluster_cbk_actors.
    
    CBKs are required only for the management connection, and the
    actors of protocol/client are NOP functions. This supposed-to-be
    NOP function dispatch tabble is actually ending up pointing to
    the actor table of glusterfsd or gfapi.
    
    These functions, even though set wrongly, are not even expected
    to be called through the protocol/client callback path. Glusterd
    however sends the FETCHSPEC (and other) notify callbacks to *all*
    connected clients unconditionally, and there is a small period
    of time when protocol/client is connected to glusterd for
    PORTMAP query. If the FETCHSPEC callback notify is issued in
    this window of time, we end up calling the wrong actor in the
    client side resulting in a crash.

    gsyncd / geo-rep: "disjoint" cascading geo-replication sessions
    
    Slave's xtime is now stored on the master itself (and that too only on
    the root), which implies it cannot be propogated to the cascaded slave.
    Thus the intermediate master now makes use of it's own volume information
    to propogate volume-mark and xtime.
    
    On starting Geo-Replication "geo-replication.ignore-pid-check" marker
    option is enabled, which is an override for the client-pid check in
    marker. This options triggers marker update only for geo-replication
    auxillary mount (client-pid == -1). Since gsyncd not does setxattr()
    directly on the bricks, this option won't trigger a chain of spurious
    metadata updates that would need to be processed by gsyncd.

    features/marker: force xtime updates (configurable) for client-pid = -1
    
    This is required by Geo-Replication that does auxillary mount
    with client-pid as -1 (which has special treatment at specific
    places in GlusterFS), to trigger xtime updates on the intermediate
    master in a cascading setup.
    
    Marker too had a check to "not" mark updates for geo-replication's
    auxillary mounts. With the new geo-replication design, xtimes are
    not set by the master on the slave for all entities. Due to this
    cascading setups were broken.
    
    This patch introduces "geo-replication.ignore-pid-check" option
    as a "override" for the client-pid check for gsyncd's client-pid.
    When this options is enabled, marker start "marking" even if the
    updates are from the special client.
    
    Geo-Replication on the detection of itself being an intermediate
    master, enables this option.

    gsyncd / geo-rep: introduce "recovery" mode
    
    This mode introduces and optimized recovery of master,
    used during failover-failback cases. Files are only
    transferred if they are identified as changed on the slave.
    
    A normal failback mechanism would be just to reverse the
    direction of geo-replication syncing. Doing this is the
    correct way but could be time consuming. "Recovery" mode
    optimizes this by identifying files (as skipping them) duing
    the one-shot crawl.
    
    NOTE: Use this mode when you are _absolutely_ sure that the
    namespace on the master is intact, ie. there is number of files
    in master is equal to the number of files in the slave, but the
    slave was written to (after a failover) when master was brought
    back up.

    gsyncd / geo-rep: Introduce basic crawl instrumentation
    
    This patch extends the persistent instrumentation work done by
    Aravinda (@avishwa), by introducing a handfull of instrumentation
    variables for crawl. These variables are "pulled up" by glusterd
    in the event of a geo-replication status cli command and looks
    something like below:
    
    "Uptime=00:21:10;FilesSyned=2982;FilesPending=0;BytesPending=0;DeletesPending=0;"
    
    "FilesPending", "BytesPending" and "DeletesPending" are short-lived
    variables that are non-zero when a changelog is being processes (ie.
    when an active sync in ongoing). After a successfull changelog process
    "FilesPending" is summed up into "FilesSynced". The three short-lived
    variabled are then reset to zero and the data is persisted
    
    Additionally this patch also reverts some of the changes made for
    BZ #986929 (those were not needed).

    geo-replication: Use a md5 based unique control path
    
    A hostname fqdn can be of length 255 according to RFC1123
    ------------------------->
    /usr/include/bits/posix1_lim.h:#define _POSIX_HOST_NAME_MAX  255
    <-------------------------
    On linux this length is 64
    ------------------------->
    /usr/include/bits/local_lim.h:#define HOST_NAME_MAX 64
    <-------------------------
    
    When a given hostname is > 45 (characters) - SSH fails with
    
    -------------------------->
    "ControlPath too long for Unix domain socket".
    <--------------------------
    
    Indicating that the total length of ControlPath which is
    on linux should be 108
    
    ------------------------->
    /usr/include/linux/un.h:#define UNIX_PATH_MAX   108
    <-------------------------
    
    This leads to "faulty" geo-replication status.
    
    This patch brings in a new file called manifest which carries
    given a geo-rep session some unique information - with which
    a unique `md5` is generated in a 32length digest, this ensures
    that we don't exceed UNIX_PATH_MAX limitations instead we use
    a conservative approach and still be able to provide a unique
    socket path.

    performance/readdir-ahead: introduce directory read-ahead translator
    
    This is a translator to improve the performance of typical,
    sequential directory reads (i.e., ls). readdir-ahead begins
    preloading the contents of a directory on open and serves readdir
    requests from the preloaded content. readdir-ahead is currently
    implemented to only handle the single threaded directory read
    case.
    
    readdir-ahead is currently disabled by default. It can be enabled
    with the following command:
    
    	gluster volume set <volname> readdir-ahead on
    
    The following are results of a getdents test on a single brick
    volume.
    
    Test info:
    
    - Single VM, gluster client/server.
    - Volume mounted with native client using --gid-timeout=2.
    - getdents on single directory with 100k 0-byte files.
    
    Test results:
    
    - !readdir-ahead
    
    read 3120080 bytes from offset 0

    This patch adds support for internals snapshots using QCOW2 and
    general framework for external snapshots (next patch) with
    QCOW2 and QED.
    
    For internal snapshots, the file must be "initialized" or
    "formatted" into QCOW2 format, and specify a file size.
    
    Snapshots can be created, deleted, and applied ("goto").
    
    e.g:
    
     // Format and Initialize
    
    sh# setfattr -n trusted.glusterfs.block-format -v qcow2:10GB /mnt/imgfile
    sh# ls -l /mnt/imgfile
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 10G Jul 18 21:20 imgfile
    
     // Create a snapshot
    
    sh# setfattr -n trusted.glusterfs.block-snapshot-create -v name1 imgfile
    
     // Apply a snapshot
    
    sh# setfattr -n trusted.gluterfs.block-snapshot-goto -v name1 imgfile

    cluster/afr: Reset attempted count before attempting blocking lock
    
    Problem:
    internal_lock->lk_attempted_count keeps track of the number of blocking
    locks attempted. lk_expected_count keeps track of the number locks expected.
    Here are the sequence of steps that happen which lead to the illution that
    a full file lock is achieved, even without attempting any lock.
    
    2 mounts are doing dd on same file. Both of them witness a brick going
    down and coming back up again. Both of the mounts issue self-heal
    1) Both mount-1, mount-2 attempt full file locks in self-heal domain.
    lets say mount-1 got the lock, mount-2 attempts blocking lock.
    
    2) mount-1 attempts full file lock in data domain. It goes into blocking
    mode because some other writes are in progress. Eventually it gets the lock.
    But this results in lk_attempted_count to be still as 2 and will not be reset.
    It completes syncing the data.
    
    3) mount-1 before unlocking final small range lock attempts full file lock in
    data domain to figure out the source/sink. This will be put into blocked mode
    again because some other writes are in progress. But this time seeing the
    stale value of lk_attempted_count being equal to lk_expected_count, blocking_lock
    phase thinks it completed locking without acquiring a single lock :-O.
    
    4) mount-1 reads xattrs without any lock but since it does not modify the xattrs,
    no harm is done by this phase. It tries to do unlocks and the unlocks will fail
    because the locks are never taken in data domain. mount-1 also unlocks
    self-heal domain locks.
    
    Our beloved mount-2 now gets the chance to cause horror :-(.
    
    5) mount-2 gets the full range blocking lock in self-heal domain.
    Please note that this sets lk_attempted_count to 2.
    
    6) mount-2 attempts full range lock in data domain, since there are still
    writes on going, it switches to blocking mode. But since lk_attempted_count is 2
    which is same as lk_expected_count, blocking phase locks thinks it actually got
    the full range locks even though not a single lock request went out the wire.
    
    7) mount-2 reads the change-log xattrs, which would give the number of operations
    in progress (lets call this 'X'). It does the syncing and at the end of the sync
    decrements the changelog by 'X'. But since that 'X' was introduced by 'X' number
    of transactions that are in progress, they also decrement the changelog by 'X'.
    Effectively for 'X' operations 'X' number of pre-ops are done but 2 times 'X'
    number of post-ops are done resulting in -ve changelog numbers.
    
    Fix:
    Reset the lk_attempted_count and inode locks array that is used to remember locks
    that are granted.

    nfs: prevent NFS server crash when upgrading from 3.2.x server
    
    After an upgrade the NFS3 filehandle size changed (became smaller),
    but when doing a live ugprade the client would send the old handle
    (expect ESTALE and do fresh lookup). But when reading the old
    handle we were reading it into a structure which was limited to the
    size of the new handle, while we should have been reading into a
    buffer which is as big as the NFS3 spec permits the handle size to
    be. The actor functions declare the structure on the stack. So the
    overflow is resulting in a stack corruption.

    synctask: minor enhancements
    
    - Enhance syncenv_new() to accept scaling parameters of syncproc.
      Previously the scaling parameters were hardcoded and decided at
      compile time.
    
    - New API synctask_create() which returns the created synctask. This
      is similar to synctask_new which only returned the status of whether
      a synctask could be created or not.
    
      The meaning of NULL cbk in synctask_create() means the task is
      "joinable". Until synctask_join() is called on such a synctask,
      the task is not reaped and resources are not destroyed. The
      task would be in a zombie state after synctask_fn returns and
      before synctask_join() is called.

    nfs: persistent caching of connected NFS-clients
    
    Introduce /var/lib/glusterfs/nfs/rmtab to contain a list of NFS-clients
    which have a volume mounted. The volume option 'nfs.mount-rmtab' can be
    set to an alternative filename. When the file is located on shared
    storage, multiple gNFS servers can use the same file to present a single
    NFS-server.
    
    This cache is read when a system administrator calls 'showmount -a' and
    updated when an NFS-client calls MNT or UMNT from the MOUNT protocol.
    
    Usage:
    - create a volume for storing the shared rmtab file
    - mount the volume on all storage servers, at the same location
    - make sure that the volume is mounted at boot (add to /etc/fstab)
    - place the rmtab file on the volume:
       # gluster volume set <VOLUME> nfs.mount-rmtab <MOUNTPOINT>/<FILENAME>
    - any subsequent mount requests will add an entry to this file
    - 'showmount -a' requests will return the NFS-clients using the cluster
    
    Note:
    The NFS-server does currently not support reconfigure(). When a
    configuration option is set/changed, the NFS-server glusterfs process
    gets restarted. This causes the active NFS-clients to be forgotten (the
    entries are saved in the old rmtab, but we do not have a reference to
    that file any more, so we can't re-add them). Therefor a re-mount done
    by the NFS-clients is needed before they get listed in the rmtab again.

    bug-979365.t: fix wrong expectation of encountering fsync
    
    After the append-write detection patch, FSYNCs may or may not
    be issued depeneding on the order in which writes reach the
    server (in the presence of write-behind). Fix the test case
    to understand this non-deterministic behavior.

    glusterd: add check in remove-brick start variant
    
    The 'start' variant of the remove-brick command only applies at the dht
    level wherein we can remove  all the bricks of a sub-volume (and remove
    multiple such sub-volumes) but not select bricks of it.
    
    This patch disallows removing individual replica bricks of multiple
    sub-volumes (i.e. reducing the replcia count of the volume) using
    remove-brick 'start'. The preferred method for such an operation is to use
    commit force.
    
    This patch also reverts the check to prevent removal of bricks from a
    replicate volume (commit 0d415f7)

    cli: Add server uuid into volume brick info xml
    
    Add server uuid as an attribute to the existing brick details in the

    Currently, when a node has more than one ip, the oVirt-engine fails
    to map the corresponding server using the ip alone.
    If we get the host uuid along with brick details in volume info
    command it will be easy for ovirt-engine to find out the
    server and thereby we can avoid confusion in finding the server.

    protocol/server: Relax lktable finodelk del_locker check
    
    Problem:
    Client xlator issues finodelk using anon-fd when the fd is not
    opened on the file. This can also happen between attempts to re-open
    the file after client disconnects. It can so happen that lock is taken
    using anon-fd and the file is now re-opened and unlock would come with
    re-opened fd. This will lead to leak in lk-table entry, which also
    holds reference to fd which leads to fd-leak on the brick.
    
    Fix:
    Don't check for fds to be equal for tracking finodelks.
    Since inodelk is identified by (gfid, connection, lk-owner)
    fd equality is not needed.

    afr: treat appending writes as stable writes.
    
    Durability of appending writes is implicit in the file size. Therefore
    performing an explicit fsync() is unnecessary in such cases as self-heal
    can check for the size of file when pending changelog is not unambiguous.

    libgfapi : Fix for hardlink creation on SMB mount
    
    Previously the inode of the hard link was left uninitialised hence
    glfs_loc_link() used to fail with invalid parameter.Since inode is
    same for both the files in hard link creation,   updated the inode
    field of hard link to be same as that of the original file.

    glusterd: remove-brick:Allow simultaneous removal of multiple subvolumes.
    
    Currently, remove-brick supports removal of only one distributed
    stripe/ replica pair at a time. Fix it to support removal of multiple
    pairs. This is consistent with add-brick behaviour which supports adding
    multiple stripe/replica pairs simultaneously.
    
    Removal is successful irrespective of the order of the bricks given at
    the CLI, as long as the bricks are from the same subvolume(s).

    log: set ident to openlog
    
    at syslog side, log message is identified by its properties like
    programname, pid, etc.  brick/mount processes need to be identified
    uniquely as they are different process of gluterfsd/glusterfs.  At
    rsyslog side, log separated by programname/app-name with pid works but
    bit hard to identify them in long run which process is for what
    brick/mount.
    
    This patch fixes by setting identity string at openlog() which sets
    programname/app-name as similar to old style log file prefixed by
    gluster, glusterd, glusterfs or glusterfsd

    afr: check for non-zero call_count before doing a stack wind
    
    When one of the bricks of a 1x2 replicate volume is down,
    writes to the volume is causing a race between afr_flush_wrapper() and
    afr_flush_cbk(). The latter frees up the call_frame's local variables
    in the unwind, while the former accesses them in the for loop and
    sending a stack wind the second time. This causes the FUSE mount process
    (glusterfs) toa receive a SIGSEGV when the corresponding unwind is hit.
    
    This patch adds the call_count check which was removed when
    afr_flush_wrapper() was introduced in commit 29619b4e

    features/locks: Convert old style metadata locks to new-style
    
    Problem:
    In 3.3, inode locks of both metadata and data are competing in same
    domain called data domain (old style). This coupled with eager-lock,
    delayed post-ops introduce delays for metadata operations like chmod,
    chown etc. To avoid this problem, inode locks for metadata ops are
    moved to different domain called metadata domain in 3.4 (new style).
    But when both 3.3 clients and 3.4 clients are present, 3.4 clients
    for metadata operations still need to take locks in "old style" so
    that proper synchronization happens across 3.3 and 3.4 clients. Only
    when all clients are >= 3.4 locks will be taken in "new style" for
    metadata locks. Because of this behavior as long as at least one 3.3
    client is present, delays will be perceived for doing metadata
    operations on all 3.4 clients while data operations are in
    progress (Ex: Untar will untar one file per sec).
    
    Fix:
    Make locks xlators translate old-style metadata locks to new-style
    metadata locks. Since upgrade process suggests upgrading servers
    first and then clients, this approach gives good results.
    
    Tests:
    1) Tested that old style metadata locks are converted to new style by
       locks xlator using gdb
    2) Tested that disconnects purge locks in meta-data domain as well
       using gdb and statedumps.
    3) Tested that untar performance is not hampered by meta-data and
       data operations.
    4) Had two mounts one with orthogonal-meta-data on and other with
       orthogonal-meta-data off ran chmod 777 <file> on one mount and
       chmod 555 <file> on the other mount in while loops when I took
       statedumps I saw that both the transports are taking lock on
       same domain with same range.

    It's way better than what we have currently. It's the original text from Jeff's
    blog [1][2][3][4], unedited aside from the title, so that the content can be
    properly attributed.

    Necessary editing will follow:
    * Nicer endings/openings of the subsections, as they are no longer separate articles
    * Wrap lines in terminal outputs so that they render nicely in PDF
    * Remove HeksFS references
    * Remove first person fear of developer wrath for manual creation of a volfile

    fuse: sync fuse_kernel.h from linux 3.11.0(-rc3) header
    
    The linux 3.11 fuse kernel header supports up through version 7.22.
    Gluster has incrementally supported versions up to 7.22. This is a
    hard sync of the most recent kernel header to resolve various,
    minor descrepencies and facilitate updates going forward. The
    following changes are included:
    
    - Re-typed data structure definitions.
    - Missing comments and init flag definitions (i.e., splice).
    - Code format and whitespace differences.
    
    No functional changes are included.

    fuse-bridge: update to protocol minor version 22
    
    7.17
    - Distinguishes between POSIX and BSD locking support via a
      separate BSD locking support init flag. Older protocol versions
      (since BSD support was added) export both types of locking
      requests if FUSE_POSIX_LOCKS is specified. Gluster sets this
      flag, so set FUSE_FLOCK_LOCKS as well on kernels that support
      version 17 or newer.
    
    7.18
    - Adds ioctl() support for directories (and the associated
      FUSE_IOCTL_DIR flag). Gluster does not support the ioctl
      request, so no changes are required. Update the header.
    - Adds support for the delete notification to allow a filesystem
      to inform the kernel of a deleted inode. No gluster changes
      required.
    
    7.19
    - Adds support for the fallocate request. Gluster already supports
      fallocate and includes the request opcode definition and data
      structure. Update the header version number.
    
    7.20
    - Adds the FUSE_AUTO_INVAL_DATA init flag to enable attribute
      updates on reads and automatic cache invalidation on mtime
      changes. Behavior does not change unless the init flag is
      specified, no gluster changes required. Update header.
    
    7.21
    - Adds readdirplus support and updates the poll request to include
      events. Gluster already supports readdirplus and includes the
      relevant data structures. Poll is not supported, so no changes
      are required. Update the header with some missing
      READDIRPLUS_AUTO bits.
    
    7.22
    - Adds real asynchronous direct I/O support. Gluster already
      supports/enables the associated bit (FUSE_ASYNC_DIO), no further
      changes are required. Update the header.

    Lets say mount1 has eager-lock(full-lock) and after the eager-lock

    perform any data operations until mount1 releases eager-lock.
    To avoid such scenario do not enable eager-lock for transaction

    store: Add (un)locking functionality
    
    Some configuration/cache files (like the NFS rmtab) can be stored on
    a GlusterFS volume and be used by multiple storage servers. This
    requires suitable locking for the gf_store_handle_t structure. Introduce
    gf_store_lock() and gf_store_unlock() for this purpose. The
    gf_store_locked_local() function can be used to check if the
    gf_store_handle_t has been locked by the current process.
    
    This change also includes an unrelated correction where a FILE* was
    getting leaked. Krishnan Parthasarathi identified this while reviewing
    the new locking functionality.

    performance/io-threads: fix potential use after free crash
    
    do_iot_schedule() enqueues the stub and kicks the worker thread.
    The stub is eventually destroyed after it has been resumed and thus
    unsafe to access after being enqueued.
    
    Though likely difficult to reproduce in a real deployment, a crash
    is reproducible by running a smallfile benchmark on a replica 2
    volume on a single vm. Reorder the debug log message prior to the
    do_iot_schedule() call to avoid the crash.

    build: Better configure control & messages for xml output
    
    Users were not given a correct indication to whether xml output was
    going to be built on running configure as the only information was lost
    in the checks output. This would lead to conditions where the user would
    assume gluster was compiled with xml output, when it wasn't the case.
    
    With this change, a new line is added to the end of the configure output
    which indicates if xml output is being built or not. Also, a new
    configure flag, '--disable-xml-output', has been introduced which can be
    used to explicitly disable xml outpu from being built.

    Because of posix default_acl on parent directory, the mode
    of linkfile can get masked with the mode in the default acl.
    
    This breaks DHT integrity. So let the mode get explicitly reset

    Performing syncop_create() on a pre-existing file can result
    in opening the linkfile if DHT has a linkfile for the file.
    This is because dht_create() will perform the op on the

    glusterd : initiating gsyncd restart during add-brick
    
    During add-brick, when a new brick is added in one of the
    nodes that was already a part of the existing volume, and
    gsyncd was already running on that node, then all gsyncd
    processes running on that node, for that particular master
    and any slave sessions will be restarted
    
    If a new brick is added in a new node, then after adding the
    brick, the user has to perform the following steps:
    
    1. gluster system:: execute gsec_create
    2. gluster volume geo-replication <master-vol> <slave-vol> create push-pem force
    3. gluster volume geo-replication <master-vol> <slave-vol> start force

    libglusterfs/client_t client_t implementation, phase 1
    
    Implementation of client_t
    
    The feature page for client_t is at
    http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/Planning34/client_t
    
    In addition to adding libglusterfs/client_t.[ch] it also extracts/moves
    the locktable functionality from xlators/protocol/server to libglusterfs,
    where it is used; thus it may now be shared by other xlators too.
    
    This patch is large as it is. Hooking up the state dump is left to do
    in phase 2 of this patch set.
    
    (N.B. this change/patch-set supercedes previous change 3689, which was
    corrupted during a rebase. That change will be abandoned.)

    storage/posix: implement batched fsync in a single thread
    
    Because of the extra fsync()s issued by AFR transaction, they
    could potentially "clog" all the io-threads denying unrelated
    operations from making progress.
    
    This patch assigns a dedicated thread to issues fsyncs, as
    an experimental feature to understand performance characteristics
    with the approach.
    
    As a basis, incoming individual fsync requests are grouped into
    batches, falling in the same @batch-fsync-delay-usec window of
    time. These windows can extend in practice, as processing of
    the previous batch can take longer than @batch-fsync-delay-usec
    while new requests are getting batched.
    
    The feature support three modes (similar to the -S modes of fs_mark)
    
    - syncfs: In this mode one syncfs() is issued per batch, instead
      of N fsync()s (one per file.)
    
    - syncfs-single-fsync: In this mode one syncfs() is issued per
      batch (which, on Linux, guarantees the completion of write-out
      of dirty pages in the filesystem up to that point) and one single
      fsync() to synchronize or flush the controller/drive cache. This
      corresponds to -S 2 of fsmark.
    
    - syncfs-reverse-fsync: In this mode, one syncfs() is issued per
      batch, and all the open files in that batch are fsync()'ed in
      the reverse order of the queue. This corresponds to -S 4 of
      fsmark.
    
    - reverse-fsync: In this mode, no syncfs() is issued and all the
      files in the batch are fsync()'ed in the reverse order. This
      corresponds to -S 3 of fsmark.

    glusterfsd: Use dynamic volfile buffer
    
    Glusterfsd used a fixed buffer to store volfiles fetched via getspec.
    This caused problems with large volfiles. Changining this to a dynamic
    buffer allows large volfiles to be loaded in memory.

    features/changelog: changelog translator
    
    This is the initial version of the Changelog Translator.
    
    What is it
    -----------
    Goal is to capture changes performed on a GlusterFS volume.
    The translator needs to be loaded on the server (bricks) and
    captures changes in a plain text file inside a configured
    directory path (controlled by "changelog-dir", should be
    somewhere in <export>/.glusterfs/changelog by default).
    
    Changes are classified into 3 types:
        - Data:     : TYPE-I
        - Metadata  : TYPE-II
        - Entry     : TYPE-III
    
    Changelog file is rolled over after a certain time interval
    (defauls to 60 seconds) after which a changelog is started.
    The thing to be noted here is that for a time interval
    (time slice) multiple changes for an inode are recorded only
    once (ie. say for 100+ writes on an inode that happens within
    the time slice has only a single corresponding entry in the
    changelog file). That way we do not bloat up the changelog
    and also save lots of writes.
    
    Changelog Format
    -----------------
    TYPE-I and TYPE-II changes have the gfid on the entity on
    which the operation happened. TYPE-III being a entry op
    requires the parent gfid and the basename. Changelog format
    has been kept to a minimal and it's upto the consumers to
    do the heavy loading of figuring out deletes, renames etc..
    A single changelog file records all three types of changes,
    with each change starting with an identifier ("D": DATA,
    "M": METADATA and "E": ENTRY). Option is provided for the
    encoding type (See TUNABLES).
    
    Consumers
    ----------
    The only consumer as of today would be geo-replication, although
    backup utilities, self-heal, bit-rot detection could be possible
    consumers in the future.
    
    CLI
    ----
    By default, change-logging is disabled (the translator is present
    in the server graph but does nothing). When enabled (via cli) each
    brick starts to log the changes. There are a set of tunable that
    can be used to change the translators behaviour:
    
    - enable/disable changelog (disabled by default)
      gluster volume set <volume> changelog {on|off}
    
    - set the logging directory (<brick>/.glusterfs/changelogs is the
      default)
      gluster volume set <volume> changelog-dir /path/to/dir
    
    - select encoding type (binary (default) or ascii)
      gluster volume set <volume> encoding {binary|ascii}
    
    - change the rollover time for the logs (60 secs by default)
      gluster volume set <volume> rollover-time <secs>
    
    - when secs > 0, changelog file is not open()'d with O_SYNC flag
    - and fsync is trigerred periodically every <secs> seconds.
      gluster volume set <volume> fsync-interval <secs>
    
    features/changelog: changelog consumer library (libgfchangelog)
    
    A shared library is provided for the consumer of the changelogs
    for easy acess via APIs. Application can link against this library
    and request for changelog updates. Conversion of binary logs to
    human-readable ascii format is also taken care by the library which
    keeps a copy of the changelog in application provided working
    directory.

    log: enhance syslog logging using CEE format
    
    This patch enables to use syslog as log target in addition to the
    default.  The logs are sent in CEE format (http://cee.mitre.org/).
    This logging can be disabled using compile time option by
    
    ./configure --disable-syslog
    (or)
    rpmbuild glusterfs.tar.gz --without syslog
    
    The framework provides two api
    
    void gf_openlog (const char *ident, int option, int facility);
    void gf_syslog (int error_code, int facility_priority, char *format, ...);
    
    consumers need to call gf_openlog() prior to gf_syslog() like the way
    traditional syslog function calls.  error_code is mandatory when using
    gf_syslog().  For example,
    
    gf_openlog (NULL, -1, -1);
    gf_syslog (GF_ERR_DEV, LOG_ERR, "error reading configuration file");
    
    Using syslog, admin is free to configure logger to
    * reduce repeated log messages
    * forward logs to remote logger
    * execute a command on certain log pattern
    * alert people for certain log pattern by email, snmp etc
    * and many more

    log: error code generation support
    
    error code and message are generated at compile time by reading a json
    file which contains information of elements for each error code.  This
    framework provides error handling and ability to do more cleaner log
    messages to users.
    
    error-codes.json file contains error description is below format
    
    {
        "ERR_NAME": {"code": ERR_NUM,
                     "message": {"LOCALE": "ERR_MESSAGE"}}
    }
    
    At compile time autogen.sh calls gen-headers.py which produces C
    header file libglusterfs/src/gf-error-codes.h.  This header has a
    function
    
    const char *_gf_get_message (int code);
    
    which returns respective ERR_MESSAGE for given ERR_NUM.

    fuse: auxiliary gfid mount support
    
    * files can be accessed directly through their gfid and not just
      through their paths. For eg., if the gfid of a file is
      f3142503-c75e-45b1-b92a-463cf4c01f99, that file can be accessed
      using <gluster-mount>/.gfid/f3142503-c75e-45b1-b92a-463cf4c01f99
    
      .gfid is a virtual directory used to seperate out the namespace
      for accessing files through gfid. This way, we do not conflict with
      filenames which can be qualified as uuids.
    
    * A new file/directory/symlink can be created with a pre-specified
      gfid. A setxattr done on parent directory with fuse_auxgfid_newfile_args_t
      initialized with appropriate fields as value to key "glusterfs.gfid.newfile"
      results in the entry <parent>/bname whose gfid is set to args.gfid. The
      contents of the structure should be in network byte order.
    
      struct auxfuse_symlink_in {
            char     linkpath[]; /* linkpath is a null terminated string */
      } __attribute__ ((__packed__));

      An initial consumer of this feature would be geo-replication to
      create files on slave mount with same gfids as that on master.
      It will also help gsyncd to access files directly through their
      gfids. gsyncd in its newer version will be consuming a changelog
      (of master) containing operations on gfids and sync corresponding
      files to slave.
    
    * Also, bring in support to heal gfids with a specific value.
      fuse-bridge sends across a gfid during a lookup, which storage
      translators assign to an inode (file/directory etc) if there is
      no gfid associated it. This patch brings in support
      to specify that gfid value from an application, instead of relying
      on random gfid generated by fuse-bridge.
    
      gfids can be healed through setxattr interface. setxattr should be
      done on parent directory. The key used is "glusterfs.gfid.heal"
      and the value should be the following structure whose contents
      should be in network byte order.
    
      typedef struct {
            char      gfid[UUID_CANONICAL_FORM_LEN + 1]; /* a null terminated gfid
                                                          * string in canonical form
                                                          */
            char      bname[]; /* a null terminated basename */
      } __attribute__((__packed__)) fuse_auxgfid_heal_args_t;
    
      This feature can be used for upgrading older geo-rep setups where gfids
      of files are different on master and slave to newer setups where they
      should be same. One can delete gfids on slave using setxattr -x and
      .glusterfs and issue stat on all the files with gfids from master.

    core: avoid infinite mutual recursion between THIS and gf_log
    
    This caused a stack overflow when (for some unknown reason) pthread_setspecific
    was failing.  Therefore __glusterfs_this_location called gf_log which used THIS
    which wraps __glusterfs_this_location which . . . you get the idea.  We have to
    break the loop somewhere, and we can't reasonably make _gf_log stop using THIS,
    so we make __glusterfs_this_location stop using _gf_log.

    mount/fuse: unlink the inode on revalidate if entry not found
    
    If an inode/dentry is linked via a client and removed via a
    separate client, the inode/dentry mapping in the initial client
    remains. A lookup of the removed name on the initial client
    typically returns ENOENT once the associated caches expire. If the
    initial client has multiple dentries linked to the same inode,
    however, lookups on the non-removed dentry create windows of time
    where lookups on the stale/removed name return successfully. This
    occurs because the stale mapping resolves to the still valid inode
    and tricks md-cache into returning valid lookup data.
    
    To correct this situation, unlink the stale inode mapping on a
    failed (ENOENT) revalidation lookup (i.e., when fuse has resolved
    the inode but a lookup returns ENOENT). Note that with this change,
    the state still occurs until an md-cache window has expired,
    allowed a lookup to pass through to the server and given the fuse
    translator an opportunity to clean up.

    T4,MP2# (dht_discover_cbk gets success for lookup as the entry
            existed, as layout is not yet written, it says normalize
            done, found holes).
    T5,MP2# (as layout anomaly is not considered an issue in this patch,
            dht_layout_set happens on inode, with all xlators pointing

    cluster/dht: Prevent dht_access from going into a loop.
    
    If access fails with ENOTCONN, do not wind to same subvol.
    We wind to first-up-subvol if access fails with ENOTCONN.
    In few cases, if dht has only 1 subvolume, and access fails with
    ENOTCONN, we go into a infinite loop of winding to same subvol
    
    The fix is to check if we previously wound to same subvol, and
    fail if first-up-subvol is same.

    tests: call 'cleanup' at the end of each test
    
    Some tests do not cleanup after themselves. That is bad behaviour and
    makes it difficult to run single tests and verify the state of the

    cluster/*: get logic to calculate min() of the 'stime' xattr
    
    * in both distribute and replicate (ignoring stripe for now),
      add logic to calculate the min() of stime values.
    
    * What is a 'stime' ? Why is this required:
      -  stime means 'slave xtime', mainly used to keep track of slave
      node's sync status when distributed geo-replication is used.
      Logic of calculating 'min()' for this stime is very important as
      in case of crashes/reboots/shutdown, we will have to 'restart'
      with crawling from stime time value from the mount point, which
      gives the 'min()' of all the bricks, which means, we don't miss
      syncing any files in the above cases.

    By removing the xattrs and Sticky bits from dst (through fd ops),
    the stale link file would be cleaned up eventually (even if unlink

    currently two keys are exposed:
    
    'glusterfs.gfid' : output is 16byte binary gfid
    'glusterfs.gfid.string' : output is 36 byte canonical format of gfid
    
    e.g.
    [root@supernova glusterfs]# getfattr -n glusterfs.gfid -e hex f0
    glusterfs.gfid=0x68305acb73e541719804fcf36a4857e8

    glusterfs.gfid.string="68305acb-73e5-4171-9804-fcf36a4857e8"
    
    early consumers for this key would be geo-replication
    (as it has being designed to do namespace operations on
    gfid from the mount point, thereby needing the GFID for
    entry operations on the slave).

    posix: add a simple health-checker
    
    Goal of this health-checker is to detect fatal issues of the underlying
    storage that is used for exporting a brick. The current implementation
    requires the filesystem to detect the storage error, after which it will
    notify the parent xlators and exit the glusterfsd (brick) process to
    prevent further troubles.
    
    The interval the health-check runs can be configured per volume with the
    storage.health-check-interval option. The default interval is 30
    seconds.
    
    It is not trivial to write an automated test-case with the current
    prove-framework. These are the manual steps that can be done to verify
    the functionality:
    
    - setup a Logical Volume (/dev/bz970960/xfs) and format is as XFS for
      brick usage
    
    - create a volume with the one brick
    
        # gluster volume create failing_xfs glufs1:/bricks/failing_xfs/data
        # gluster volume start failing_xfs
    
    - mount the volume and verify the functionality
    
    - make the storage fail (use device-mapper, or pull disks)
    
        # dmsetup table
        ..
        bz970960-xfs: 0 196608 linear 7:0 2048
    
        # echo 0  196608 error > dmsetup-error-target
        # dmsetup load bz970960-xfs dmsetup-error-target
        # dmsetup resume bz970960-xfs
    
        # dmsetup table
        ...
        bz970960-xfs: 0 196608 error
    
    - notice the errors caught by syslog:

    fuse: pass the mountflags to older (< 2.6.21) kernels
    
    The change for Bug 853895 fixed mounting volumes read-only for recent
    kernels. Older kernels fail the first mount() syscall, and the second
    mount() did not add the 'mountflags'.
    
    Full analysis and a description for reproducing is in the bugreport. The
    test included in http://review.gluster.org/4163 would have caught this
    problem when the tests are executed on RHEL-5 or similar systems.

    cluster/afr: Let two data-self-heals compete in new domain
    
    Problem:
    At the moment data-self-heal acquires locks in following
    pattern. It takes full file lock then gets xattrs on files on both
    replicas. Decides sources/sinks based on the xattrs. Now it acquires
    lock from 0-128k then unlocks the full file lock. Syncs 0-128k range
    from source to sink now acquires lock 128k+1 till 256k then unlocks
    0-128k, syncs 128k+1 till 256k block... so on finally it takes full file
    lock again then unlocks the final small range block.
    It decrements pending counts and then unlocks the full file lock.
    
         This pattern of locks is chosen to avoid more than 1 self-heal
    to be in progress. BUT if another self-heal tries to take a full
    file lock while a self-heal is already in progress it will be put in
    blocked queue, further inodelks from writes by the application will
    also be put in blocked queue because of the way locks xlator grants
    inodelks. So until the self-heal is complete writes are blocked.
    
    Here is the code:
    xlators/features/locks/src/inodelk.c - line 225
    if (__blocked_lock_conflict (dom, lock) && !(__owner_has_lock (dom, lock))) {
             ret = -EAGAIN;
             if (can_block == 0)
                     goto out;
    
             gettimeofday (&lock->blkd_time, NULL);
             list_add_tail (&lock->blocked_locks, &dom->blocked_inodelks);
    }
    
    This leads to hangs in applications.
    
    Fix:
    Since we want to prevent two parallel self-heals. We let them compete
    in a separate "domain". Lets call the domain on which the locks have
    been taken on in previous approach as "data-domain".
    
    In the new approach When a self-heal is triggered,
    it acquires a full lock in the new domain "self-heal-domain".
        After this it performs data-self-heal using the locks in
        "data-domain" as before.
    unlock the full file lock in "self-heal-domain"
    
    With this approach, application's writevs don't have to wait
    in pending queue when more than 1 self-heal is triggered.

    cluster/afr: Refactor inodelk to handle multiple domains
    
    - afr_local_copy should not be memduping locked nodes, that would
      mean that lock is taken in self-heal on those nodes even before
      it actually takes the lock. So removed memdup code. Even entry
      lock related copying (lockee info) is also not necessary for
      self-heal functionality, so removing that as well. Since it is
      not local_copy anymore changed its name.

    cluster/afr: post-op should complete before starting flush
    
    Problem:
    At the moment afr-flush makes sure that a delayed post-op
    is woken up but it does not wait for it to complete the
    post-op before flush unwinds.
    These are the steps that are happening:
    1) flush fop comes on an fd which wakes up a delayed post-op
    and continues with the flush fop.
    2) post-op sends fsync on the wire.
    3) flush completes and unwinds to fuse.
    4) graph switch happens on the fuse mount disconnecting the
    old graph's client connections to bricks.
    5) xattrop after fsync fails with ENOTCONN because the
    connections from old graph are taken down now.
    
    Fix:
    Wait for post-op to complete before starting to flush.
    We could make flush act similar to fsync (i.e.) wind
    flush as is but wait for post-op to complete before unwinding
    flush, but it is better to send flush as the final fop. So
    wind of flush will start after post-op is complete. Had to
    change fsync to accommodate this change.

    cluster/afr: Allow data/entry self heal for metadata split-brain
    
    Problem:
    Currently whenever there is metadata split-brain, a variable
    sh->op_failed is set to 1 to denote that self heal got failed.
    But if we proceed for data self heal, even code-path of data
    self heal also relies on the sh->op_failed variable. So if will
    check for sh->op_failed variable and will eventually fails to
    do data self heal. So needed a mechanism to allow data self heal
    even if metadata is in split brain.
    
    Fix:
    Some data structure revamp is done in
    http://review.gluster.com/#/c/5106/ fix and this patch is
    based on the above fix. Now we can store which particular self-heal
    got failed i.e GFID_OR_MISSING_ENTRY_SELF_HEAL, METADATA, DATA,
    ENTRY. And we can do two types of self heal failure check.
    1. Individual type check: We can check which among all four
       (Metadata, Data, Gfid or missing entry, entry self heal)
       got failed.
    
    2. In afr_self_heal_completion_cbk, we need to make check
       based on the fact that if any specific self heal got failed treat
       the complete self heal as failure so that it will populate
       corresponding circular buffer of event history accordingly.

    build: declare lvm_lv_from_name() if it is missing from lvm2app.h
    
    The bd-xlator can not be built successfully on certain Debian
    distributions due to a missing declaration of lvm_lv_from_name(). This
    function is available for linking, but it does not exist in the header
    file.
    
    This change adds a detection for lvm_lv_from_name() in both the library
    for linking, and the declaration in the header file. If the 1st is
    missing, the bd-xlator can not be built, and if only the 2nd one is
    missing, we'll declare lvm_lv_from_name() ourselves. This makes it
    possible to build the bd-xlator on the affected Debian distributions
    too.

    cluster/afr: Perform delayed changelog wakeups for anon fd
    
    Problem:
    Nfs xlator never does open on a file for performing writes,
    afr does not perform changelog wakeup for this fd so operations
    which do metadata operations as soon as the data operations are
    completed perceive a delay of 'post-op-delay-secs'.
    
    Fix:
    Perform changelog wakeup on anon-fd if the fd with same pid is
    not present in inode-list.
    
    Note:
    This approach is a short-term fix. A proper fix needs a new domain
    for taking metadata locks so that data/metadata locks don't compete
    with each other.

    glusterd: Disable transport before cleaning up rpc object
    
    Problem:
    rpc_transport object, which is part of rpc_clnt, is destroyed
    prematurely. This is because, rpc_transport object is ref'd by socket
    layer and rpc layer. These ref's, until the synctask'izing of
    operations, were unref'd sequentially in the epoll thread.
    With more threads at play, the sequential unref guarantee is off.
    
    Fix:
    Shutting down the transport before proceeding with cleaning up of
    rpc_clnt object would serialize the unref's on the rpc_transport object
    and thus eliminating the race.
    
    Also, we don't store the address of brickinfo in brick's rpc notify
    function, to avoid the possibility of referring a freed brickinfo.
    Instead we use a string based id to 'reach' the corresponding brickinfo.

    protocol/rpc: move latest added procedures to the end of the array
    
    While looking at the newly introduced procedures FALLOCATE and DISCARD,
    it seems that these were added with already existing procedure numbers.
    This makes the protocol incompatible with existing roll-outs.
    
    It is very confusing when new procedures are added somewhere in the
    middle of the array. This will cause the number of existing procedures
    to change. It is much preferred to add new procedures at the end of the
    array. This changes not only corrects the enum that generates the
    procedure numbers, but also the ordering in the client and server
    fops-array for clarity.
    
    Correcting this greatly simplifies adding support for these new

    rpc: Cleanup rpc object in TRANSPORT_CLEANUP event
    
    rpc_transport object should be alive as long as the rpc_clnt object is
    alive. To ensure this, on rpc_clnt's last unref, we cleanup the
    corresponding rpc_transport object and complete the rpc_clnt cleanup
    later, in a bottom-up fashion.
    
    Introduced rpc_clnt_is_disabled, to allow higher layers to differentiate
    between the 'final'[1] disconnect triggered from upper layers, and a
    normal disconnect. This differentiation helps in cleaning up resources,
    at higher layers, in a race-free manner.
    
    [1] - 'final' here means that the rpc and the associated connection, is
    not going to be used anymore. eg - glusterd_brick_disconnect on
    volume-stop.

    cluster/afr:  Improvement in logging of self heal completion status
    
    Problem:
    As the end of the self heal, message logged by
    "afr_self_heal_completion_cbk" is inadequate to determine what exactly failed
    during the course of afr self heal. It is worth to have knowledge of what all
    types of self heal got triggered for an entity and whether the status is success
    or failure.
    
    Fix:
    At the end of self heal, it will log information about out of 4 types of self
    heal (gfid or missing entry self heal, metadata, data and entry self heal),
    who all got triggered and who all got failed or successful at the end.

    libglusterfs: Fix circular buffer to dump entries if count is less than 1024
    
    Problem:
    To dump the values present in the circular buffer, index always
    moves from current index to used_len. But if circular buffer is not
    completely filled even once then next index to be filled  and used length
    value are always same which means it will never dump any value.
    
    Fix: Modified the logic of buffer traversing to dump values so that  it
    will still maintain FIFO and cover both the cases where buffer is either
    partially filled or being used more than once.

    glusterfs: discard (hole punch) support
    
    Add support for the DISCARD file operation. Discard punches a hole
    in a file in the provided range. Block de-allocation is implemented
    via fallocate() (as requested via fuse and passed on to the brick
    fs) but a separate fop is created within gluster to emphasize the
    fact that discard changes file data (the discarded region is
    replaced with zeroes) and must invalidate caches where appropriate.

    This is needed since we generate uuid of a node in a lazy manner. ie, we

    force[1] the uuid generation, without a volume or peer operation performed.

    cluster/afr: Avoid order mismatch in blocking entrylks
    
    Problem:
    When taking blocking entrylks, afr orders the entrylks based on
    uuid_compare of gfids of parent dirs, if they are equal then it orders
    them based on the basenames. While this approach works fine, the
    implementation assumes loc->gfids to be populated at the time of
    the comparison, but loc may have gfid in loc->inode->gfid instead
    of loc->gfid which was leading to order mismatches and dead-locks.
    
    Fix:
    Implemented loc_gfid which gives gfid by checking both loc->gfid,
    loc->inode->gfid. Used this for ordering the blocking entrylks.

    glusterd-syncop: Fix unlocking and collating errors
    
    * Only those peers which were locked need to be unlocked.
    * Fix location of collating errors in callbacks. The callback functions
      could miss collating errors if there was an rpc error.

    cluster/dht: Set layout when inode is present
    
    Problem:
    Lookups in discovery fail with ENOENT so local->inode
    is never set. dht_layout_set logs the callstack when
    the function is called in that state.
    
    Fix:
    Don't set layout when lookups fail in discovery.

    cluster/dht: Linkfiles creation with correct uid/gid
    
    If renames are done with different uid/gid (non-owners), then we would
    end up with incorrect uid/gid.
    
    The fix is to create linkfiles, and heal the uid/gid as root:root. This
    preserves our notion of creation as root:root and heal the uid/gid as
    root:root in all paths. Additionally, we need to consider uid/gid from
    only src_cached subvol, and not from linkfiles.
    
    rename is also done as root:root if done on linkfile, as setattr of ownership
    on linkfile is done after the rename

    cluster/dht: getxattr linkto as root:root
    
    In path based op's like truncate, we use getxattr instead of
    fgetxattr call. These can fail with permission denied issues
    as linkto file creation, and setattr of ownership is not atomic,
    and in cases where setattr failed (subvols down..)
    
    The fix is to perform getxattr as root:root as it is a internal
    fop. fgetxattr, bypass the access check, as it already has a valid
    open fd.

    api/Makefile: link api.so against libgfapi (and dependencies)
    
    Samba opens vfs_gluster.so with dlopen(..,RTLD_LOCAL). This makes
    the symobls in the shared module and the library it exclusively
    links against (specifically gfapi) not resolvable from the .so
    files which are opened in turn within (like xlator .so files)
    unless explicitly linked against the dependent libraries.
    
    This is not otherwise required in case of glusterfsd as the main
    executable symbols are always available for resolution from
    dlopen()'ed shared objects, making Samba's vfs_glusterfs
    requirement unique, but luckily not incompatible.

    protocol/client: Prevent excessive logging of client's "disconnect" messages.
    
    Problem: Currently when gluster volume start force is executed, client process
             will talk to glusterd to get the port of the brick. But if brick's path
             is not available it cannot return brick's port. So client process will
             keep connecting and disconnecting from glusterd for port-query which
             is ultimately responsible for execssive logging of disconnect messages.
    
    Fix:     Message will be logged just once at INFO level after the first
             disconnect from glusterd. Afterwards "disconnect" messages will be
             logged in DEBUG mode.

    checks on its existence to fail. When glusterd was stopped successfully,
    the $PIDFILE has been removed already, there is no need to try to remove
    is again.
    
    Upon executing '/sbin/service glusterd status', the message 'glusterd

    dht,posix: support for case discovery
    
    This is support for discovering a filename in a given directory
    which has a case insensitive match of a given name. It is implemented
    as a virtual extended attribute on the directory where the required
    filename is specified in the key.
    
    E.g:
    
      sh# getfattr -e "text" -n user.glusterfs.get_real_filename:FiLe-B /mnt/samba/patchy
      getfattr: Removing leading '/' from absolute path names
      # file: mnt/samba/patchy
      user.glusterfs.get_real_filename:FiLe-B="file-b"
    
    In reality, there can be multiple "answers" as the backend filesystem is
    case sensitive and there can be multiple files which can strcasecamp()
    successfully. In this case we pick the first matched file from the first
    responding server.
    
    If a matching file does not exist, we return ENOENT (and NOT ENODATA).
    This way the caller can differentiate between "unsupported" glusterfs
    API and file not existing.
    
    This API is used by Samba VFS to perform efficient discovery of the real
    filename without doing a full scan at the Samba level.

    gfapi: optimistic resolution with ESTALE detection
    
    Enhance the path resolver to be optimistic. Instead of performing
    a wasteful ->lookup() fop for every component in every API call,
    build in speculation logic to consider the previous resolution
    result temporarily, and if it results in ESTALE either later in
    the path resolution or in the FOP, then retry resolution with
    ->lookup() at every level and retry the FOP.
    
    This is the same optimistic resolution/retry logic Linux kernel
    resolver is proposing to use.

    glusterd: Give up biglock during rpc conn cleanup
    
    glusterd could deadlock after a peer-detach command as follows,
    
    1) glusterd_friend_cleanup function 'flushes' out messages in the rpc
    layer's queue, that haven't received a response. At this point, glusterd
    has already acquired the big lock.
    
    2) The side-effect of flushing out the messages is that the
    corresponding call backs are called.
    
    Call backs themselves are executed after acquiring the big lock. This
    results in the big lock being acquired in a nested manner (in the same
    thread),  which causes
    a deadlock.
    
    This can also happen during brick/NFS/SHD disconnect in volume-stop.

    rpm: automatically load the fuse module on EL5
    
    The fuse module needs to be loaded before /dev/fuse can be used. On
    RHEL6 and Fedora the module is loaded on demand. RHEL5 needs to load the
    module manually.
    
    This change add a script under /etc/sysconfig/modules/ that loads the
    fuse module on boot and packages it in the EL5 version of
    glusterfs-fuse.
    
    One of the features of GlusterFS is to not depend on additional fuse
    userspace. The conditional requires on /usr/bin/fusermount is not
    needed, this command is never called in the current version (even though
    is it referenced in the sources).

    syncop: Remove task from syncbarrier's waitq before 'wake'
    
    Removing task from syncbarrier's waitq after wake could result in a
    subsequent syncbarrier_wake, wake'ing up the already running task.  This
    fix makes the removal from waitq and wake 'atomic'
    
    The root cause and the fix are similar in spirit to what was observed
    in synclock's waitq implementation.

    syncop: Update synctask state appropriately
    
    * Earlier, SYNCOP macro, the only consumer of synctask_yield, would set
    the task->state to SYNCTASK_SUSPEND. Today, we have glusterd having its
    own wrapper macros which don't set task's state. There is also the
    syncbarrier and synclock framework, which also participate in a
    synctask's scheduling (and need to keep a task's state up to date). It
    only makes more sense to leave a synctask's state to the synctask
    library, since its an internal affair.
    
    * Need to 'yawn' before 'yield' to avoid re-running tasks to set
      task->woken appropriately.

    The restarting of bricks has been deffered until the cluster 'stabilizes'

    were taken offline for say, maintenance purposes. This fix avoids that.

    rpcsvc: fix dangerous setting of pointer on free'd structure
    
    The current code is setting @req->hdr_iobuf = NULL _after_ calling
    actor_fn() on @req. Calling actor_fn() takes away all guarantees
    of whether @req is still a valid object or destroyed.
    
    Unfortunately most of the times the object is allocated from mem-pool
    an a mem_put() still keeps the arena allocated (no crash). However
    once the mem-pool is full and allocation falls back to malloc()/free()
    the code actually becomes dangerous. This resulted in random crashes
    when the system load is high (when there were sufficient outstanding
    calls that @rpc pool got full)

    glusterd: Set op-version on startup based on install status
    
    If the current installation of glusterfs doesn't have a stored
    op-version and is,
    a. a fresh install, then set op-version to maximum
    b. an upgrade from release which didn't have op-version support, set it
    to minimum.
    
    The install status is detected using the peer-uuid.
    If both peer-uuid and op-version are not present in the store, the
    installation is fresh.
    If peer-uuid is present, but op-version is absent in the store, the
    installation has been upgraded from a version which didn't support
    op-versions.
    
    By setting the initial op-version as above, we can ensure that
    a. features are not enabled accidentally during upgrades
    b. a fresh install starts with all possible features enabled.

    gluster/CLI: crash upon executing "peer status" command
    
    Problem:
    While doing "gluster peer status", cli_cmd_peer_status_cbk() creates
    the frame and passes as arg to gf_cli_list_friends() which sets
    frame->local to GF_CLI_LIST_PEERS flag (value: 0x1). It expects
    gf_cli_list_friends_cbk() [invoked through cli_cmd_submit()] to
    reset frame->local to NULL. But if cli_cmd_submit() fails some
    where before gf_cli_list_friends_cbk() gets invoked, then the
    flag value remains in frame->local and causes a SEGV while
    destroying the stack i.e. [CLI_STACK_DESTROY => cli_local_wipe()].
    
    Fix:
    In gf_cli_list_friends(), if cli_cmd_submit() fails, then
    reset the value of frame->local to NULL.

    cluster/afr: Club missing entry, missing gfid self-heals
    
    Problem:
    gfid-self-heal always assigns the gfid(GFID-1) it gets from lookup.
    Between the time of lookup to triggering the gfid-self-heal the
    entry could have changed. Now lets say there is a case where
    one of the files of the replica subolumes already has a gfid
    (GFID-2) and the other does not. In that case healing should
    happen with GFID-2 instead of GFID-1.
    
    Fix:
    Missing-entry-self-heal already handles all these cases. So removed
    separate handling of gfid-self-heal.

    Revert "glusterd: Fix spurious wakeups in glusterd syncops"
    
    This reverts commit efa154bb0a4cac34d5a9610ec25d38eebe495f22.
    
    -- Following is Avati's analysis (edited) from gerrit --
    The claim of the patch (being reverted) is that it in some cases cbkfn
    is missed.  This is wrong analysis. cbk_fn is _always_ called. The patch
    treats ret > 0 as a "missed cbk". ret > 0 only means socket submission
    was not complete, and is queued to submit asynchronously when POLLOUT is
    raised.  This is sufficient to guarantee that cbkfn is going to be
    called (either the socket errors or submission succeeds and reply
    eventually arrives).
    
    This commit also removes spurious barrier_wake(s).
    
    call backs are guaranteed to be called even if the transport is
    disconnected. This means, a 'wake' would be called if rpc_clnt_submit is
    called.  Also, we count both successful and failed operations in a
    particular batch of operations for the synctask_barrier_wait.  So,
    calling synctask_barrier_wake on failure of rpc_clnt_submit (say, due to
    network failure) would result in a spurious wake.

    synctask: implement barriers around yield, not the other way
    
    In the current implementation, barriers are in the core of the
    syncprocessors. Wake()s are treated as syncbarrier wake. This
    is however delicate, as spurious wake()s of the synctask can
    mess up the accounting of the barrier and waking it prematurely.
    
    The fix is to keep yield() and wake() as the basic primitives,
    and implement barriers as an object impelemented on top of these
    primitives. This way, only an explicit barrier_wake() gets
    counted towards the barrier accounting, and spurious wakes
    will be truly safe.

    cluster/afr: Avoid self-healing extended attribute used by SELinux.
    
    Since removexattr() fails to remove "security.selinux" in a system
    where SELinux is enforcing, xattr self-healing fails.
    As a consequence of this, user extended attributes are not being healed.
    Added a check in afr to prune SELinux xattr from the dictionary
    used for removing xattrs from the sink.
    
    Minor changes in tests and md-cache as well.

    glusterd: Removed 'proactive' failing of volume op
    
    Volume operations were failed 'proactively', on the first disconnect of
    a peer that was participating in the transaction.
    
    The reason behind having this kludgey code in the first place was to
    'abort' an ongoing volume operation as soon as we perceive the first
    disconnect. But the rpc call backs themselves are capable of injecting
    appropriate state machine events, which would set things in motion for an
    eventual abort of the transaction.

    tests: Modified test to use remove-brick instead of 'start' variant
    
    remove-brick start doesn't remove the brick from the volume immediately.
    It would wait until migration of data to other bricks are complete. Even
    when there is no data to be migrated, one can expect a finite delay from
    the time of remove-brick start command's exit and removal of brick(s).
    This may cause subsequent checks on brick count to fail in a
    non-deterministic manner.
    
    Also, renamed the test file name to reflect bug-id corresponding to
    community release.

    extras: include Fedora changes in init.d/glusterd
    
    The changes in the .spec file from Fedora have largely been merged into
    the glusterfs.spec.in. It seems that some dependencies have been missed,
    most importantly some additions to the init-script that are called while
    (un)installing or updating RPMs.
    
    These changes come from the downstream Fedora package that carries its
    own glusterd.init script. In future, Fedora/EPEL should be able to drop
    that file and use the Gluster project version.

    glusterd: Introduce volume op-versions
    
    Each volume is now associated with two op-versions,
     * op_version - the op-version of the highest op-versioned feature enabled
     * client_op_version - the op-version of the highest op-versioned feature
       enabled which affects the clients only.
    
    These two op-versions are generated dynamically and kept updated during
    runtime. Glusterd now uses the respective volumes' client-op-version during
    getspec requests.
    
    To achieve the above a new field in the vme table is introduced,
    client_option, this boolean field tells if the option is a client side
    option.

    glusterd: validate performance.nfs.* option values during volume set stage
    
    PROBLEM:
    
    performance.nfs.* option values (which are of type boolean) are
    not validated during the stage phase of 'volume set'.
    The result - nfs graph generation fails during commit phase,
    AFTER the option and its (invalid) value have been placed in
    volinfo->dict.
    
    CAUSE:
    
    nfsperfxl_option_handler() - the function that validates the values of
    performance.nfs.* options - never receives the (key,value) pair that
    needs to be set, for validation during 'volume set' stage.
    
    FIX:
    
    In build_nfs_graph(), copy the (mod_)dict containing the (option,value)
    parameters into set_dict before attempting to build the client graph
    for the volume on which the operation is being performed.
    
    Of course, an easier way out would be to simply do a 'volume reset' and
    pretend nothing wrong happened!

    glusterd: Avoided deadlock in single node cluster, glusterd restart
    
    In a single node cluster, it is possible to deadlock on the "big
    lock", while restarting bricks. In glusterd_restart_bricks, we perform a
    glusterd_brick_connect, where we release the big lock in anticipation
    that glusterd_brick_rpc_notify could run in the same C stack (and
    deadlocking). So, in the restart code path, we could unlock before we
    have performed a lock on the big lock.
    
    To fix this, we need to take the big lock in the
    glusterd_launch_synctask 'thread' as well.

    object-storage: turn off stat() for container list
    
    Turn of stat() system calls used to fetch the file size during a
    container listing operation since these system calls can swamp Gluster
    and the result is most often not used.
    
    When a GET or HEAD request is made on a container, stat() system calls
    are made during the Python standard library method, os.walk, to
    determine if a given directory entry is another directory to recurse
    into, and then utils._update_list() will stat() each file to get it
    size, and finally utils.get_container_details_from_fs() will stat()
    each directory encountered.
    
    For most installations we have seen so far, we don't need the
    container listing to accurately return the size of all the objects in
    the container, so we can reduce the number of stat() system calls by
    not fetching the size of the object.
    
    For now, turn it off by default, and provide an /etc/swift/fs.conf
    configuration parameter to turn it back on:
    
      accurate_size_in_listing = yes
    
    The default for the above is "no".

    glusterd: big lock - a coarse-grained locking to prevent races
    
    There are primarily three lists that are part of glusterd process,
    that are concurrently accessed. Namely, priv->volumes, priv->peers
    and volinfo->bricks_list.
    
    Big-lock approach
    -----------------
    WHAT IS IT?
    Big lock is a coarse-grained lock which protects all three
    lists, mentioned above, from racy access.
    
    HOW DOES IT WORK?
    At any given point in time, glusterd's thread(s) are in execution
    _iff_ there is a preceding, inbound network event. Of course, the
    sigwaiter thread and timer thread are exceptions.
    A network event is an external trigger to glusterd, via the epoll
    thread, in the form of POLLIN and POLLERR.
    As long as we take the big-lock at all such entry points and yield
    it when we are done, we are guaranteed that all the network events,
    accessing the global lists, are serialised.
    
    This amounts to holding the big lock at
    - all the handlers of all the actors in glusterd. (POLLIN)
    - all the cbks in glusterd. (POLLIN)
    - rpc_notify (DISCONNECT event), if we access/modify
      one of the three lists. (POLLERR)
    
    In the case of synctask'ized volume operations, we must remember that,
    if we held the big lock for the entire duration of the handler,
    we may block other non-synctask rpc actors from executing.
    For eg, volume-start would block in PMAP SIGNIN, if done incorrectly.
    To prevent this, we need to yield the big lock, when we yield the
    synctask, and reacquire on waking up of the synctask.

    tests: fix further issues with bug-874498.t
    
    The failure of bug-874498.t seems to be a "bug" in glustershd.
    The situation seems to be when both subvolumes of a replica are
    "local" to glustershd, and in such cases glustershd is sensitive
    to the order in which the subvols come up.
    
    The core of the issue itself is that, without the patch (#4784),
    self-heal daemon completes the processing of index and no entries
    are left inside the xattrop index after a few seconds of volume
    start force. However with the patch, the stale "backing file"
    (against which index performs link()) is left. The likely reason
    is that an "INDEX" based crawl is not happening against the subvol
    when this patch is applied.
    
    Before #4784 patch, the order in which subvols came up was :
    
      [2013-04-09 22:55:35.117679] I [client-handshake.c:1456:client_setvolume_cbk] 0-patchy-client-0: Connected to 10.3.129.13:49156, attached to remote volume '/d/backends/brick1'.
      ...
      [2013-04-09 22:55:35.118399] I [client-handshake.c:1456:client_setvolume_cbk] 0-patchy-client-1: Connected to 10.3.129.13:49157, attached to remote volume '/d/backends/brick2'.
    
    However, with the patch, the order is reversed:
    
      [2013-04-09 22:53:34.945370] I [client-handshake.c:1456:client_setvolume_cbk] 0-patchy-client-1: Connected to 10.3.129.13:49153, attached to remote volume '/d/backends/brick2'.
      ...
      [2013-04-09 22:53:34.950966] I [client-handshake.c:1456:client_setvolume_cbk] 0-patchy-client-0: Connected to 10.3.129.13:49152, attached to remote volume '/d/backends/brick1'.
    
    The index in brick2 has the list of files/gfid to heal. It appears
    to be the case that when brick1 is the first subvol to be detected
    as coming up, somehow an INDEX based crawl is clearing all the
    index entries in brick2, but if brick2 comes up as the first subvol,
    then the backing file is left stale.
    
    Also, doing a "gluster volume heal full" seems to leave out stale
    backing files too. As the crawl is performed on the namespace and
    the backing file is never encountered there to get cleared out.
    
    So the interim (possibly permanent) fix is to have the script issue
    a regular self-heal command (and not a "full" one).
    
    The failure of the script itself is non-critical. The data files are
    all healed, and it is just the backing file which is left behind. The
    stale backing file too gets cleared in the next index based healing,
    either triggered manually or after 10mins.

    cluster/distribute: Ignore non-participating subvols for layout checks
    
    When subvols-per-directory is < available subvols, then there are layouts
    which are not populated. This leads to incorrect identification of holes or
    overlaps. We need to ignore layouts, which have err == 0, and start == stop.
    In the current scenario (start == stop == 0).
    
    Additionally, in layout-merge, treat missing xattrs as err = 0. In case of
    missing layouts, anomalies will reset them.
    
    For any other valid subvoles, err != 0 in case of layouts being zeroed out.
    
    Also reverted back dht_selfheal_dir_xattr, which does layout calculation only
    on subvols which have errors.

    syncenv: be robust against spurious wake()s
    
    In the current implementation, when the callers of synctasks perform
    a spurious wake() of a sleeping synctask (i.e, an extra wake() soon
    after a wake() which already woke up a yielded synctask), there is
    now a possibility of two sync threacs picking up the same synctask.
    This can result in a crash. The fix is to change ->slept = 0|1 and
    membership of synctask in runqueue atomically.
    
    Today we dequeue a task from the runqueue in syncenv_task(), but
    reset ->slept = 0 much later in synctask_switchto() in an unlocked
    manner -- which is safe, when there are no spurious wake()s.
    
    However, this opens a race window where, if a second wake() happens
    after the dequeue, but before setting ->slept = 0, it results in
    queueing the same synctask in the runqueue once again, and get
    picked up by a different synctask.
    
    This is has been diagnosed to be the crashes in the regression tests
    of http://review.gluster.org/4784. However that patch still has a
    spurious wake() [the trigger for this bug] which is yet to be fixed.

    afr: let eager-locking do its own overlap checks
    
    Today there is a non-obvious dependence of eager-locking on
    write-behind. The reason is that eager-locking works as long
    as the inheriting transaction has no overlaps with any of the
    transactions already in progress. While write-behind provides
    non-overlapping writes as a side-effect most of times (and only
    guarantees it when strict-write-ordering option is enabled,
    which is not on by default) eager-lock needs the behavior
    as a guarantee. This is leading to complex and unwanted checks
    for the presence of write-behind in the graph, for the simple
    task of checking for overlaps.
    
    This patch removes the interdependence between eager-locking
    and write-behind by making eager-locking do its own overlap checks
    with in-progress writes.

    object-storage: use tox for unit tests; fix em too
    
    Add the ability to use tox for unit tests, since it helps us solve the
    problem of supporting multiple branches that require different
    versions of dependencies, and allows us to possibly support multiple
    versions of python in the future.
    
    Also fix the code to work with pre-grizzly environments, by not
    requiring the constraints backport.
    
    Also fixed the xattr support to work with both pyxattr and xattr
    modules.
    
    And fixed the ring tests to also work without a live /etc/swift
    directory.

    posix: fix dangerous "sharing" of fd in readdir between two requests
    
    posix_fill_readdir() is a multi-step function which performs many
    readdir() calls, and expects the directory cursor to have not
    "seeked away" elsewhere between two successive iterations. Usually
    this is not a problem as each opendir() from an application has its
    own backend fd, and there is nobody else to "seek away" the directory
    cursor. However in case of NFS's use of anonymous fd, the same fd_t
    is shared between all NFS readdir requests, and two readdir loops can
    be executing in parallel on the same dir dragging away the cursor in
    a chaotic manner.
    
    The fix in this patch is to lock on the fd around the loop. Another
    approach could be to reimplement posix_fill_readdir() with a single
    getdents() call, but that's for another day.

    pump: Set self-heal readdir size in pump
    
    Problem:
    In Pump entry self-heal happens for each directory during the
    first opendir using conservative merge. But in entry-self-heal
    readdir is issued with '0' size. So entry self-heal is not
    creating any files. After pump thinks entry self-heal is complete
    it proceeds to heal each of the file in the directory it just
    healed. Fortunately most of the times it chooses source-brick
    in pump as read-child for readdir. This happens because readchild is the
    subvolume on which lookup succeeds first. In pump lookup succeeds
    faster in local process than on the destination brick process most
    of the times. For all the entries pump finds in readdir it does a
    lookup. During this lookup the entry on the destination brick is
    created and healed. This is the reason why replace-brick
    succeeds whenever read-child for the directory is chosen as the
    source-brick.  Which is most of the times. When read-child is chosen
    as the destination brick, readdir returns no entries so replace-brick
    completes without syncing the whole data.
    
    Fix:
    Set readdir-size in pump so that entry self-heal happens with
    64k size. This ensures that entry self-heal triggered from
    opendir actually creates the files on the destination brick.

    The fusermount available in gluster is customized to ensure
    mounting with SELinux happens properly, i.e - to have a separate

    and in parallel perform sys_mount() in a different thread, thereby
    avoiding a deadlock.
    
    However our build and packaging defaults to not including our
    fusermount. This patch reverses the defaults.

    cluster/afr: detect in-progress creation in lookup and return ENOENT
    
    if any subvol returned ENOENT while parent entrylk lock was held,
    yield and return ENOENT for the entire lookup.
    
    This is how the issue happens:
    
    Multiple clients A, B and C are attempting 'mkdir -p /mnt/a/b/c'
    
    1 Client A is in the middle of mkdir(/a). It has acquired lock.
      It has performed mkdir(/a) on one subvol, and second one is still
      in progress
    2 Client B performs a lookup, sees directory /a on one,
      ENOENT on the other, succeeds lookup.
    3 Client B performs lookup on /a/b on both subvols, both return ENOENT
      (one subvol because /a/b does not exist, another because /a
      itself does not exist)
    4 Client B proceeds to mkdir /a/b. It obtains entrylk on inode=/a with
      basename=b on one subvol, but fails on other subvol as /a is yet to
      be created by Client A.
    5 Client A finishes mkdir of /a on other subvol
    6 Client C also attempts to create /a/b, lookup returns ENOENT on
      both subvols.
    7 Client C tries to obtain entrylk on on inode=/a with basename=b,
      obtains on one subvol (where B had failed), and waits for B to unlock
      on other subvol.
    8 Client B finishes mkdir() on one subvol with GFID-1 and completes
      transaction and unlocks
    9 Client C gets the lock on the second subvol, At this stage second
      subvol already has /a/b created from Client B, but Client C does not
      check that in the middle of mkdir transaction
    10 Client C attempts mkdir /a/b on both subvols. It succeeds on
       ONLY ONE (where Client B could not get lock because of
       missing parent /a dir) with GFID-2, and gets EEXIST from ONE subvol.
    This way we have /a/b in GFID mismatch. One subvol got GFID-1 because
    Client B performed transaction on only one subvol (because entrylk()
    could not be obtained on second subvol because of missing parent dir --
    caused by premature/speculative succeeding of lookup() on /a when locks
    are detected). Other subvol gets GFID-2 from Client C because while
    it was waiting for entrylk() on both subvols, Client B was in the
    middle of creating mkdir() on only one subvol, and Client C does not
    "expect" this when it is between lock() and pre-op()/op() phase of the
    transaction.

    Adds missing functions to ring.py, and more thorough tests.
    
    Situation:
    The function get_part_nodes is being called by Openstack-Swift's proxy/controllers/base.py:
            https://github.com/openstack/swift/blob/1.7.4/swift/proxy/controllers/base.py#L410
            https://github.com/openstack/swift/blob/1.7.6/swift/proxy/controllers/base.py#L447
    As this was not implemented in the current GlusterFS version of ring.py, it was calling swift's
    original get_part_nodes, which would often return the incorrect node, resulting in the incorrect
    drive being associated with a request.
    There is another function that the original ring.py implements -- get_other_nodes, which has to
    do with replication.  Since GlusterFS is handling replication, this function should never be
    called.  However, in the interest of completeness, that function is also being replaced.
    
    Code changes:
    The two functions, get_part_nodes, and get_other_nodes have been implemented to override the
    default functions, and get_nodes has been updated to store information in self vars, about the
    account being operated on, as the two new functions are not called with that info, and get_nodes
    appears to always be called first.
    The code has be refactored to all call _get_part_nodes, much like swift has refactored their code.
    
    Reason for implementation this way:
    I didn't see a better way to do it, but am open to suggestions.
    
    Test cases:
    A mock ring is created with two different devices, test and iops
    
    test_first_device: Ensure that the first device, test, is returned for both get_nodes, and
            get_part_node, and get_more_nodes returns volume_not_in_ring.
    test_invalid_device: Ensure that a request for a non-existant device returns volume_not_in_ring.
    test_second_device: Same as test_first_device, but for the second device, iops instead of test.
    test_second_device_with_reseller_prefix: Test that calling with the reseller prefix, AUTH_ will
            still return the correct data.

    synctask: introduce synclocks for co-operative locking
    
    This patch introduces a synclocks - co-operative locks for synctasks.
    Synctasks yield themselves when a lock cannot be acquired at the time
    of the lock call, and the unlocker will wake the yielded locker at
    the time of unlock.
    
    The implementation is safe in a multi-threaded syncenv framework.
    
    It is also safe for sharing the lock between non-synctasks. i.e, the
    same lock can be used for synchronization between a synctask and
    a regular thread. In such a situation, waiting synctasks will yield
    themselves while non-synctasks will sleep on a cond variable. The
    unlocker (which could be either a synctask or a regular thread) will
    wake up any type of lock waiter (synctask or regular).
    
    Usage:
    
        Declaration and Initialization
        ------------------------------
    
        synclock_t lock;
    
        ret = synclock_init (&lock);
        if (ret) {
            /* lock could not be allocated */
        }
    
       Locking and non-blocking lock attempt
       -------------------------------------
    
       ret = synclock_trylock (&lock);
       if (ret && (errno == EBUSY)) {
          /* lock is held by someone else */
          return;
       }
    
       synclock_lock (&lock);
       {
          /* critical section */
       }
       synclock_unlock (&lock);

    cluster/afr: prevent piggyback on stale pre_op

    offset 0 length 7680 with changelog status: -1 -1
    
    According to these logs fsync did not happen after writev with
    offset: 79360, len: 15716. Which is the reason for this problem.
    
    In total 3 writes came. lets call them w1, w2, w3
    w1 does pre_op so pre_op_done[0], pre_op_done[1] counts become 1 and 1
    then is_piggyback_post_op() is called for w1 and it returns *false*
    
    w1's fsync is fired
    
    Now w2 and w3 come and see that pre_op_done[0], pre_op_done[1] are both 1,
    so pre_op_piggyback[0] and pre_op_piggyback[1] are both incremented twice,
    once by w2, one more time by w3 and become 2, 2  ------- Step-A
    
    Now fsync of w1 is complete and it goes ahead with post op and decrements
    pre_op_done[0], pre_op_done[1] to 0, 0
    
    Now w2, w3 writevs complete and is_piggyback_post_op will return *true* for
    both w2, w3.
    So fsync is not fired for both w2, w3
    
    this patch prevents Step-A from happening.

    dht: improve transform/detransform of d_off (and be ext4 safe)
    
    The scheme to encode brick d_off and brick id into global d_off has
    two approaches. Since both brick d_off and global d_off are both 64-bit
    wide, we need to be careful about how the brick id is encoded.
    
    Filesystems like XFS always give a d_off which fits within 32bits. So
    we have another 32bits (actually 31, in this scheme, as seen ahead) to
    encode the brick id - which is typically plenty.
    
    Filesystems like the recent EXT4 utilize the upto 63 low bits in d_off,
    as the d_off is calculated based on a hash function value. This leaves
    us no "unused" bits to encode the brick id.
    
    However both these filesystmes (EXT4 more importantly) are "tolerant" in
    terms of the accuracy of the value presented back in seekdir(). i.e, a
    seekdir(val) actually seeks to the entry which has the "closest" true
    offset.
    
    This "two-prong" scheme exploits this behavior - which seems to be the
    best middle ground amongst various approaches and has all the advantages
    of the old approach:
    
    - Works against XFS and EXT4, the two most common filesystems out there.
      (which wasn't an "advantage" of the old approach as it is borken against
       EXT4)
    
    - Probably works against most of the others as well. The ones which would
      NOT work are those which return HUGE d_offs _and_ NOT tolerant to
      seekdir() to "closest" true offset.
    
    - Nothing to "remember in memory" or evict "old entries".
    
    - Works fine across NFS server reboots and also NFS head failover.
    
    - Tolerant to seekdir() to arbitrary locations.
    
    Algorithm:
    
    Each d_off can be encoded in either of the two schemes. There is no
    requirement to encode all d_offs of a directory or a reply-set in
    the same scheme.
    
    The topmost bit of the 64 bits is used to specify the "type" of encoding
    of this particular d_off. If the topmost bit (bit-63) is 1, it indicates
    that the encoding scheme holds a HUGE d_off. If the topmost bit is is 0,
    it indicates that the "small" d_off encoding scheme is used.
    
    The goal of the "small" d_off encoding is to stay as dense as possible
    towards the lower bits even in the global d_off.
    
    The goal of the HUGE d_off encoding is to stay as accurate (close) as
    possible to the "true" d_off after a round of encoding and decoding.
    
    If DHT has N subvolumes, we need ROOF(Log2(N)) "bits" to encode the brick
    ID (call it "n").
    
    SMALL d_off
    ===========
    
    Encoding
    --------
        If the top n + 1 bits are free in a brick offset, then we leave the
    top bit as 0 and set the remaining bits based on the old formula:
    
       hi_mask = 0xffffffffffffffff
    
       hi_mask = ~(hi_mask >> (n + 1))
    
       if ((hi_mask & d_off_brick) != 0)
           do_large_d_off_encoding ()
    
       d_off_global = (d_off_brick * N) + brick_id
    
    Decoding
    --------
        If the top bit in the global offset is 0, it indicates that this
    is the encoding formula used. So decoding such a global offset will
    be like the old formula:
    
       if ((d_off_global & 0x8000000000000000) != 0)
          do_large_d_off_decoding()
    
       d_off_brick = (d_off_global % N)
    
       brick_id = d_off_global / N
    
    HUGE d_off
    ==========
    
    Encoding
    --------
       If the top n + 1 bits are NOT free in a given brick offset, then we
    set the top bit as 1 in the global offset. The low n bits are replaced
    by brick_id.
    
        low_mask = 0xffffffffffffffff << n   // where n is ROOF(Log2(N))
    
        d_off_global = (0x8000000000000000 | d_off_brick & low_mask) + brick_id
    
        if (d_off_global == 0xffffffffffffffff)
            discard_entry();
    
    Decoding
    --------
        If the top bit in the global offset is set 1, it indicates that
    the encoding formula used is above. So decoding would look like:
    
        hi_mask = (0xffffffffffffffff << n)
        low_mask = ~(hi_mask)
    
        d_off_brick = (global_d_off & hi_mask & 0x7fffffffffffffff)
    
        brick_id = global_d_off & low_mask
    
        If "losing" the low n bits in this decoding of d_off_brick looks
    "scary", we need to realize that till recently EXT4 used to only
    return what can now be expressed as (d_off_global >> 32). The extra
    31 bits of hash added by EXT recently, only decreases the probability
    of a collision, and not eliminate it completely, anyways. In a way,
    the "lost" n bits are made up by decreasing the probability of
    collision by sharding the files into N bricks / EXT directories
        -- call it "hash hedging", if you will :-)

    cluster/afr: piggyback and fsync resume changes
    
    1) pre_op_piggyback should always be decremented.
    2) Move fsync resume to just after post_op.
    3) fsync stub should be created from afr's local
       not from the final response.

    cluster/afr: fsync() guarantees POST-OP completion
    
    AFR now provides a stronger guarantee that fsync() returns only
    after completely finishing all the deferred/delayed POST-OP on that
    open file.
    
    To acheive this we make a stub out of the returning fsync and
    register it with the "delayed" frame in afr_changelog_wake_resume().
    
    The delayed frame, after getting woken up and finishing the POST-OP
    will call_resume() the registered stub (which UNWINDs the fsync) at
    the time of frame destruction.
    
    This provides a guarantee that an application's (or FUSE) fsync()
    returns only after finishing up all the previous transactions,
    including delayed POST-OPs and UNLOCK.

    cluster/afr: ensure DATA operations are made durable before POST-OP
    
    The changelogging scheme of AFR stores information about the state
    of all replicas in all replicas (in the extended attribute of the
    respective files on each server) in the form of 'pending counts'
    of operations (effectively "dirty flags"). These xattrs are blindly
    trusted while performing self-heal, and therefore utmost care has
    to be taken while updating and maintaing them.
    
    The most critical updation is the clearing of the pending counts
    corresponding to the *other* server in the changelog of a given
    server. Before clearing the pending count, we need durability
    guarantee of the write which was performed on the other server.
    
    To obtain such a guarantee, it may be necessary to explicitly
    introduce an fsync() phase (if the file itself wasn't already
    opened with O_SYNC).
    
    This patch introduces the detection of unstable stable writes on
    a file and issues explicit fsync() on the servers before performing
    the POST-OP clearing of pending flags.

    config: better (i.e. more portable) test for libxml2
    
    Over the weekend I tried to build on MacOS X¹ and ran into the following
    issues:
    1) The recent change to autogen.sh to test for pkg-config falls down.
    2) After removing the pkg-config test in autogen.sh, w/o pkg-config the
       PKG_CHECK_MODULES macro invocation in configure[.ac] falls down. N.B.
       Solaris users run into this too, even through there's a (broken)
       pkg-config package that can be installed.
    3) There are other problems in the code related to fuse that are beyond the
       scope of this.
    
    It seems that pkg-config is only a requirement for the definition of the
    PKG_CHECK_MODULES macro used to detect libxml2. Since this seems to be
    inherently unportable — at least to MacOS X and Solaris — I'd like to:
    A) Change the use of the PKG_CHECK_MODULES macro to the more portable
       AM_PATH_XML2 macro provided by the libxml2 package in
       /usr/.../share/aclocal/libxml.m4
    2) Revisit the decision to add the check for pkg-config in autogen.sh in
       BZ 921817.
    
    For now this is just an rfc. If people are agreeable I'll reenter this
    change against BZ 921817.

    glusterfsd: dump the in-memory graph rather than volfile
    
    Currently we have been printing in the logfile, the volfile
    verbatim as received from the server. However we perform
    pre-processing on the graph we receive from the server, like
    adding ACL translator, applying --xlator-option cli params,
    etc.
    
    So print the serialized in-memory graph as the "volfile" in
    the log. This can be very handy to double check if certain
    --xlator-option param actually got applied or not, and in
    general is showing a "truer" representation of the real graph
    actually used.

    Users do not understand '... or a prefix of it is already part of

    a brick, but not its parents.
    
    It would be helpful to present the user with the actual directory that

    dht: make DHT xattr names configurable
    
    This is necessary to support "DHT over DHT" configurations, so that the
    upper and lower instances of DHT don't step all over each other.  Why
    would we even consider such a thing?  Because it gives us the ability to
    do data tiering and rack-aware placement, either by themselves or as
    complements to other functionality such as erasure codes or
    deduplication which save space but cost performance.  By setting up the
    top-level DHT to place data into one of several lower-level DHT pools
    based on policy instead of pure elastic hashing, we get better
    performance for 90% of accesses and better storage efficiency for 90% of
    data, all for relatively low effort.

      in the current code base is run-with-valgrind option for glusterd), then
      giving that option would make the process crash if the source was not
      built with debug mode enabled.
    
      Reason:
      In rpc, after getting the options symbol dynamically, it was stored in the
      newly allocated volume options structure and the structure's list head was
      added to the xlator's volume_options list. But while freeing the structure
      the list was not deleted. Thus when the list was traversed, already freed
      structure was accessed leading to segfault.

    nfs: handle stable write with @flags rather than fsync()
    
    stable writes can be "made stable" by simply setting O_SYNC (or
    O_DSYNC, accordingly) in the write flags or fd->flags. Performing
    fsync() at the end of the write is extremely inefficient and completely
    messes up eager-locking logic in AFR.

    geo-rep: retire old style ssh setup
    
    Users are still using geo-rep with the old, deprecated, insecure, unsupported
    ssh setup. Not their fault -- the implementation of the new method had the
    following charasteristics:
    - old method is possible, but with default settings it's not working
    - it can be made operational by fiddling with "remote-gsyncd" tunable
    - with default setting, an unhelpful, actually misleading error message is
      produced
    - the UI gave no hint to the changes in the ssh setup
    
    http://review.gluster.org/4392 tried to fix these; what it accomplished was
    unrestricted support to the bad practice (by making the default old setup
    operational).
    
    From this on:
    - we disable the old method by reserving the "remote-gsyncd" tunable
    - if the old method is attempted, give a hint what to do

    cluster/afr: Preserve mtime in self-heal
    
    Problem:
    Data self-heal may choose sink iatt to set mtimes.
    This happens because after syncing of data is done
    self-heal does one more xattrops/fstat to determine
    sources sinks to set the inode-ctx. Since this is done
    after data syncing and erase of xattrs, old source and
    old sink are now sources, but the mtimes of them differ.
    Old code just takes the first source from the list and
    update mtimes, which could be sink before the self-heal
    started.
    
    Fix:
    Set mtime from 'sources before syncing'.

    glusterd: Mark vol as deleted by renaming voldir before cleaning up the store
    
    PROBLEM:
    
    During 'volume delete', when glusterd fails to erase all information
    about a volume from the backend store (for instance because rmdir()
    failed on non-empty directories), not only does volume delete fail on
    that node, but also subsequent attempts to restart glusterd fail
    because the volume store is left in an inconsistent state.
    
    FIX:
    
    Rename the volume directory path to a new location
    <working-dir>/trash/<volume-id>.deleted, and then go on to clean up its
    contents. The volume is considered deleted once rename() succeeds,
    irrespective of whether the cleanup succeeds or not.

    glusterd: fix segfault on volume status detail
    
    If for some reason glusterd_get_brick_root() fails,
    it frees the gf_strdup'ed *mount_point in its own error path,
    and returns -1.
    
    Unfortunately it already had assigned that pointer value
    to the output argument, the caller function
    glusterd_add_brick_detail() sees a non-NULL pointer,
    and free() again: segfault.
    
    Could be fixed with a one-liner (*mount_point = NULL)
    in the error path, but I think glusterd_get_brick_root()
    should only assign to the output argument once all checks passed,
    so I use a local temporary pointer, which increases the patch a bit.

    gfapi: dict_unref() xattr_req in fop finish instead of dict_destroy()
    
    The current way of calling dict_destroy() at the end of an API fop assumes
    that xattr_req is not stored/ref'd by any translators in the stack. However
    when translators like DHT store xattr_req in dht_local_t with a dict_ref()
    and perform dict_unref() in the unwind path, things get subject to a race.
    
    The race is between the woken up thread (by syncop_wake) i.e, the gfapi
    invoking thread and the thread where the FOP was unwound. As the C stack
    of STACK_UNWIND unwinds back, dht_local_unref() gets invoked within the
    DHT_STACK_UNWIND macro. This thread attempts dict_unref, which would
    be "safe" if it wins the race against the gfapi invoking thread. However
    if the gfapi invoking thread wins the race, it will perform dict_destroy()
    first and therefore make dict_unref() within dht_local_unref perform
    a double free.
    
    This is the embarrassing on-screen bug which showed up in a roomful of people
    during the gluster dev summit demo of qemu/libgfapi integration.

commit 598ca6bbaabc0b67708a1ecfbef1372eb9927ed9
Author: Mohammed Junaid <junaid@redhat.com>

    object-storage: Restoring multi volume support in UFO.
    
    * Currently, the users of UFO are restricted to use just one volume
      at any given point of time. This patch removes this limitation.
    
    * The usage of gluster-swift-gen-builders has also changed. With this
      commit the users should mention the list of volumes that they want
      to expose through UFO. So, only the volumes mentioned during the
      ring file generation can be accessed.
    
      Usage: gluster-swift-gen-builders <vol-name1> [<vol-name2>]...
    
    This is an intermediate fix until we remove the account, container and
    object server processes. Once we have this frame work running, it will
    completely eliminate the ring files.

    With the present implementation, eager-lock is issued for

    transactions. But the lk-owner is set to local->fd address
    only for DATA transactions, but for METADATA transactions
    it is frame->root. Because of this unlock on the eager-lock fails
    and rebalance hangs.
    
    Fix:

    tests/cluster.rc: support for virtual multi-server glusterd tests
    
    Since http://review.gluster.org/4556 glusterd is capable of running
    many instances of itself on a single system. This patch exploits
    that feature and enhances the regression test framework to expose
    handy primitives so that test cases may be written to test glusterd
    in a cluster.
    
    Usage:
    
    1. Include "$(dirname)/../cluster.rc" to get access to the extensions
    
    2. Call launch_cluster $N where $N is the count of virtual servers
    
    Calling launch_cluster, starts $N glusterds which bind to $N different
    IPs and dynamically defines these primitives:
    
     - Variables $H1 .. $Hn assigned to hostnames of each "server".
    
     - Variables $CLI_1 .. $CLI_n assigned as commands to run CLI commands
       on the corresponding N'th server.
    
     - Variables $B1 .. $Bn assigned to the backend directories on each
       "server".
    
     - Function kill_glusterd, which accepts a parameter - index number of
       glusterd to be killed.
    
     - Variables $glusterd_1 .. $glusterd_n assigned to the command lines
       to restart the corresponding glusterd, if it was previously killed.
    
    The current set of primitives and functions were implemented with the goal
    of satisfying ./tests/bugs/bug-913555.t. The API will be made richer as
    we add more cluster test cases

    volgen: Use bind-address option for bricks when option set on glusterd
    
    Brick processes listen on all the interfaces on a given port.
    When multiple glusterds run on one machine, glusterd assumes
    that it 'owns' the ports on that machine. This can lead to the
    different glusterd instances to step on each other's ports.
    This fix ensures that brick processes listen only on the its
    host IP when glusterd has bind-address option set.

    cluster/distribute: Preserve file size during rebalance migration
    
    If holes are encountered, then we do not write these to the dst,
    which sometimes causes file size to be lesser than src. Data is not
    corrupted, as when non-zero reads are received, we do write that data.
    
    Calling a truncrate to give file size to prevent it from being
    truncated to less than src in case the file end has holes.
    
    Thanks to Brian Foster for providing the test case

    libglusterfs: Fixed valid_ipv4_address and valid_host_name
    
    In valid_ipv4_address(), strtok_r was ignoring consecutive dots,
    and was marking any address with consecutive dots as valid. Now
    such addresses will be marked as invalid.
    
    In valid_host_name(), any name ending with any special characters
    was marked as valid. Now such hostnames will be marked as invalid.

    cluster/afr: Don't queue transactions during open-fd fix
    
    Before Anonymous fds are available, afr had to queue up
    transactions if the file is not opened on one of its
    subvolumes. This happens until the attempt to open the
    file either succeeds or fails. These attempts happen
    until the file is successfully opened on the subvolume.
    Now client xlator uses anonymous fds to perform the fops
    if the fd used for the fop is not 'opened'.
    Fops will be successful even when the file is not opened
    so there is no need to queue up the transactions anymore in afr.
    Open is attempted on the subvolume where it is not
    opened independent of the fop.

    tests/fileio.rc: library for file descriptor based IO in tests
    
    There are situations in test scripts where we want to keep open file
    descriptors while performing other commands. Bash has abilities
    to manage file descriptors by numbers, but the syntax is a little
    brain damaging.
    
    This library provides wrappers around it to abstract away bash's
    syntax and also provides a helper function to pick a free file
    descriptor on the fly.
    
    The APIs are pretty self explanatory.

    synctask: support for (assymetric) counted barriers
    
    This patch introduces a new set of primitives:
    
      - synctask_barrier_init (stub)
      - synctask_barrier_waitfor (stub, count)
      - synctask_barrier_wake (stub)
    
    Unlike pthread_barrier_t, this barrier has an explicit notion of
    "waiter" and "waker". The "waiter" waits for @count number of
    "wakers" to call synctask_barrier_wake() before returning. The
    wait performed by the waiter via synctask_barrier_waitfor() is
    co-operative in nature and yields the thread for scheduling other
    synctasks in the mean time.
    
    Intended use case:
    
      Eliminate excessive serialization in glusterd and allow for
    concurrent RPC transactions.
    
      Code which are currently in this format:
    
    ---old---
    
      list_for_each_entry (peerinfo, peers, op_peers_list) {
              ...
              GD_SYNCOP (peerinfo->rpc, stub, rpc_cbk, ...);
      }
    
      ...
    
      int rpc_cbk (rpc, stub, ...)
      {
              ...
              __wake (stub);
      }
    
    ---old---
    
      Can be restructred into the format:
    
    ---new---
    
      synctask_barrier_init (stub);
      {
              list_for_each_entry (peerinfo, peers, op_peers_list) {
                      ...
                      rpc_submit (peerinfo->rpc, stub, rpc_cbk, ...);
                      count++;
               }
       }
       synctask_barrier_wait (stub, count);
    
       ...
    
       int rpc_cbk (rpc, stub, ...)
       {
               ...
               synctask_barrier_wake (stub);
       }
    
    ---new---
    
      In the above structure, from the synctask's point of view, the region
    between synctask_barrier_init() and synctask_barrier_wait() are spawning
    off asynchronous "threads" (or RPC) and keep count of how many such
    threads have been spawned. Each of those threads are expected to make
    one call to synctask_barrier_wake(). The call to synctask_barrier_wait()
    makes the synctask thread co-operatively wait/sleep till @count such threads
    call their wake function.
    
      This way, the synctask thread retains the "synchronous" flow in the code,
    yet at the same time allows for asynchronous "threads" to acheive parallelism
    over RPC.

    glusterd: allow multiple instances of glusterd on one machine
    
    This is needed to support automated testing of cluster-communication
    features such as probing and quorum.  In order to use this, you need to
    do the following preparatory steps.
    
    * Copy /var/lib/glusterd to another directory for each virtual host
    
    * Ensure that each virtual host has a different UUID in its glusterd.info
    
    Now you can start each copy of glusterd with the following xlator-options.
    
    * management.transport.socket.bind-address=$ip_address
    
    * management.working-directory=$unique_working_directory
    
    You can use 127.x.y.z addresses for binding without needing to assign
    them to interfaces explicitly.  Note that you must use addresses, not
    names, because of some stuff in the socket code that's not worth fixing
    just for this usage, but after that you can use names in /etc/hosts
    instead.
    
    At this point you can issue CLI commands to a specific glusterd using
    the --remote-host option.  So far probe, volume create/start/stop,
    mount, and basic I/O all seem to work as expected with multiple
    instances.

    This is a guarantee which AFR's eager-lock depends upon (though not

    Tests: Disable open-behind
    
    Test assumes that open on the mount point opens the files on bricks
    right away.

    call-stub: internal refactor
    
    - re-structure members of call_stub_t with new simpler layout
    - easier to inspect call_stub_t contents in gdb now
    - fix a bunch of double unrefs and double frees in cbk stub
    - change all STACK_UNWIND to STACK_UNWIND_STRICT and thereby fixed
      a lot of bad params
    - implement new API call_unwind_error() which can even be called on
      fop_XXX_stub(), and not necessarily fop_XXX_cbk_stub()

    cluster/afr: do complete split-brain check in all the fd based fops
    
    fd based operations such as readv checked only for data split brain
    instead of complete split-brain (i.e both data + metadata) assuming that
    open would have done the complete split-brain check. However open-behind
    would have unwound open, without winding to afr thus preventing the complete
    split-brain check and some appliations will be able to read the contents
    of the file even though the file has metadata split-brain. So let all
    the fd based fops do a defensive check of complete split-brain.

    distribute: add hash-name-regex option
    
    This is to support the common "write to temp file then rename" idiom. In our
    case this causes us to create a linkfile during the rename in (N-1)/N cases,
    with a significant impact on performance e.g. for UFO which uses this idiom.
    This patch allows the user to specify up to two regular expressions that
    separate the permanent and transient parts of a temp-file name:
    
        rsync-hash-regex reimplements the existing RSYNC_FRIENDLY_NAME
        pattern where the temporary name for EXAMPLE is .EXAMPLE.suffix
    
        extra-hash-regex can be used for a second pattern, active concurrently,
        and can include alternatives via the POSIX extended-regex syntax

    --snip--
    all:
    	@echo "To build RPMS run `make glusterrpms`"
    --snip--
    
    was using `backquotes` in the string, and thereby triggering a nested
    make on "glusterrpms" target implicitly as part of 'make all', thus
    defeating the intention.
    
    So use single quotes instead of backquotes.
    
    It is unexplained why this nested 'make glusterrpms' was not called on
    the build server during regression test.

    features: add a directory-protection translator
    
    This is useful to find all calls that remove a file from the protected
    directory, including renames and internal calls.  Such calls will cause
    a stack trace to be logged.  There's a filter script to add the needed
    translators, and then the new functionality can be invoked with one of
    the following commands.
    
    	setfattr -n trusted.glusterfs.protect -v log $dir
    	setfattr -n trusted.glusterfs.protect -v reject $dir
    	setfattr -n trusted.glusterfs.protect -v anything_else $dir
    
    The first logs calls, but still allows them.  The second rejects them
    with EPERM.  The third turns off protection for that directory.

    glusterfsd: Remove 'top {read,write}-perf' thread
    
    'volume top {read,write}-perf' were performed in a different thread on the brick
    process, to prevent them from blocking the main polling thread. This was
    essential earlier when the rpc actor functions were run in the epoll thread. Now
    rpc actors can be launched on their own threads with the introduction of
    synctask support for rpcsvc. The brick-op actors are now launched using this
    feature, which makes the need for '{read,write}-perf' to be performed in a new
    thread.

    cluster/distribute: Reopen fds in migration internally as root:root
    
    Though linkfile_create and rebalance dst file create sent a setattr
    with correct ownership, there is still a race window where the linkfile
    open (client open due to migration) will fail, as its ownership will be
    root:root.

    glusterd: harden 'volume start' staging to check for brick dirs' presence
    
    PROBLEM:
    
    When the brick directory of a volume is absent on any of the servers,
    AND an attempt is made to start the volume, commit fails ONLY on the
    node where the brick dir is absent, leading to a split-brain like
    situation.
    
    FIX:
    
    Harden 'volume start' to check for the presence of brick directories
    at the time of staging, thereby preventing commit failure.

    cluster/dht: pathinfo xattr changes for directories
    
    Since directories have presence on all subvolumes there is
    no definite meaning of ->hashed_subvol or ->cached_subvol.
    getxattr() code path chooses ->cached_subvol for pathinfo
    extended attribute. While this makes sense of files, it makes
    less sense for directories. Further if a hashed or a cached
    subvolume is down, and there's a getxattr request for a
    directory, we return with an errno.
    
    This patch changes pathinfo extended attribute contents by
    aggregating information from all subvolumes that are up.

    glusterfsd can't listen in a specified address
    
    When specifying transport.socket.bind-address option,
    only the glusterd daemon uses this address. But glusterfsd
    still working with the default localhost address. For
    instance, when we want to use an IPV6 specific  address we
    will want that all process use that specified address even
    glusterfsd.
    
    To handle this change we just need to replace the fixed
    address “localhost” to the specified brick address
    “brickinfo->hostname”

    dht: better layout-optimization algorithm
    
    This method deals with the case where swapping might gain a bigger overlap
    for the xlator currently under consideration, but sacrifices even more from
    the xlator we're swapping with. For example:
    
    A = 0x00000000 - 0x44444443 (new 0x00000000 - 0x55555554)
    B = 0x44444444 - 0x77777776 (new 0x55555555 - 0xaaaaaaa9)
    C = 0x77777777 - 0xffffffff (new 0xaaaaaaaa - 0xffffffff)
    
    Here, the new range for B has a bigger overlap with the old C than with the
    old B (0x33333333 vs. 0x22222222 to be precise) so looking only at that
    might lead us to swap. However, such a swap turns the new C's overlap from
    0x55555556 (vs. old C) to *zero* (vs. old B).  In other words, we've gained
    0x11111111 for B but lost 0x55555556 for C, so it's a bad idea.
    
    The new algorithm accounts for all effects of the swap, so it not only avoids
    bad swaps but can make some good ones that would have been missed previously.
    For example, if swapping a range X with a later range Y would not increase the
    overlap for X we would previously have skipped it even if the swap would
    increase Y's overlap without affecting X's.  This is the normal case when we're
    adding a new brick (which initially has zero overlap with any old range) so
    finding more good swaps is probably even more important than avoiding bad ones.
    
    Also, the logic in dht_overlap_calc was completely broken before, causing
    integer overflows instead of providing correct values, so no matter what
    higher-level algorithm was in place the GIGO effect would have resulted in
    bad decisions.

    rpcsvc: Fix memory corruption caused by rpcsvc_dump returning non-zero
    
    The convention followed is that any actor should return non-zero
    value only if it has not attempted to send the reply back. If an
    actor returns non-zero, rpcsvc_handle_rpc_call tries to send an
    error reply. Since, rpcsvc_submit_generic frees the rpc_req, its wrong
    to invoke it more than once on same rpc_req. When the transport is not
    connected, rpcsvc_dump used to pass the non-zero value it got from
     transport to rpcsvc resulting in memory corruption. Hence this patch
    makes rpcsvc_dump to return 0.

    group-virt: Change profile to include remote-dio and exclude posix-aio.
    
    remote-dio enables filtering O_DIRECT in the client xlator. This has been
    found to be useful for improving performance when there are multiple VMs
    talking to an image store.
    
    Aggregated throughput results for a single thread iozone run from multiple VMs
    and a single host can be seen below:
    
    -------------------------------------------------
    No. of VMs |   remote-dio on  |   remote-dio off |
    -------------------------------------------------
           2   |     400 MB/s     |    202 MB/s      |
           4   |     650 MB/s     |    410 MB/s      |
    --------------------------------------------------
    
    posix-aio has not been found to improve performance consistently with VM image
    workload. Hence not including that in the default virt profile.

    geo-rep / gsyncd: Separate log file directory for Mountbroker sessions
    
    ... so that a mountbroker session which is initiated b/w master
    and slave does not use the same log file if it's started after
    a normal geo-rep session b/w master and slave. This results in
    EPERM as the log file is owned by root and the geo-rep slave
    process (now running as a non privileged user) does not have
    access to it.
    
    Also, having separate log file directory for mountbroker sessions
    looks clean.
    
    NOTE: geo-rep's client mount log file location remains unchanged.

    Problem:
    --------
    Depending on the response time from different nodes, the response
    dict for rebalance status was populated in  a FIFO manner, and
    hence the output for the CLI was never consistent.
    
    Fix:
    ----
    Irrespective of the response time of the nodes, we now index the
    entries in the response dict for rebalance status, in reference
    to the peerlist. So, the order of the entries and hence the CLI
    output is always consistent.

    Have the co-routine (greenlet) yield during long running directory
    tree walks to avoid starving out other greenlets that might be
    available to run.
    
    A directory walk involves statting every file in the tree to get it

    after every stat call, and after processing every directory.

    cluster/dht: Correct min_free_disk behaviour
    
    Problem:
    Files were being created in subvol which had less than
    min_free_disk available even in the cases where other
    subvols with more space were available.
    
    Solution:
    Changed the logic to look for subvol which has more
    space available.
    In cases where all the subvols have lesser than
    Min_free_disk available , the one with max space and
    atleast one inode is available.
    
    Known Issue: Cannot ensure that first file that is
    created right after min-free-value is crossed on a
    brick will get created in other brick because disk
    usage stat takes some time to update in glusterprocess.
    Will fix that as part of another bug.

    cluster/dht: ignore EEXIST error in mkdir to avoid GFID mismatch
    
    In dht_mkdir_cbk, EEXIST error is treated like a true error. Because
    of this the following sequence of events can happen, eventually
    resulting in GFID mismatch and (and possibly leaked locks and hang,
    in the presence of replicate.)
    
    The issue exists when many clients concurrently attempt creation of
    directory and subdirectory (e.g mkdir -p /mnt/gluster/dir1/subdir)
    
    0. First mkdir happens by one client on the hashed subvolume. Only
       one client wins the race. Others racing mkdirs get EEXIST. Yet
       other "laggers" in the race encounter the just-created directory
       in lookup() on the hash dir.
    
    1. At least one "lagger" lookup() notices that there are missing
       directories on other subvolumes (which the "winner" mkdir is yet
       to create), and starts off self-heal of the directory.
    
    2. At least on some subvolumes, self-heal's mkdir wins the race
       against the "winner" mkdir and creates the directory first. This
       causes the "winner" mkdir to experience EEXIST error on those
       subvolumes.
    
    3. On other subvolumes where "winner" mkdir won the race, self-heal
       experiences EEXIST error, but self-heal is properly translating
       that into a success (but mkdir code path is not -- which is the
       bug.)
    
    4. Both mkdir and self-heal assign hash layouts to the just created
       directory. But self-heal distributes hash range across N (total)
       subvolumes, whereas mkdir distributes hash range across N - M
       (where M is the number of subvolumes where mkdir lost the race).
       Both the clients "cache" their respective layouts in the near
       future for all future creates inside them (evidence in logs)
    
    5. During the creation of the subdirectory, two clients race again.
       Ideally winner performs mkdir() on the hashed subvolume and proceeds
       to create other dirs, loser experiences EEXIST error on the hashed
       subvolume and backs off. But in this case, because the two clients
       have different layout views of the parent directory (because of
       different hash splits and assignements), the hashed subvolumes for
       the new directory can end up being different. Therefore, both clients
       now win the race (they were never fighting against each other on a
       common server), assigning different GFIDs to the directory on their
       respective (different) subvolumes. Some of the remaining subvolumes
       get GFID1, others GFID2.
    
    Conclusion/Fix:
       Making mkdir translate EEXIST error as success (just the way self-heal
       is already rightly doing) will bring back truth to the design claim
       that concurrent mkdir/self-heals perform deterministic + idempotent
       operations. This will prevent the differing "hash views" by different
       clients and thereby also avoid GFID mismatch by forcing all clients
       to have a "fair race", because the hashed subvolume for all will be
       the same (and thereby avoiding leaked locks and hangs.)

    protocol/client: Periodically attempt reopens
    
    If the brick is taken down and the hard disk is replaced
    and the brick is brought back up, the re-opens of the open-fds
    will fail because the file is not present on the brick.
    Re-opens are not attempted even if the files are re-created by
    self-heal until the brick is brought down after the files are
    re-created and brought back up. This is a problem with a VM-store
    in a replica-setup.  Until the fd is re-opened the writes will
    never happen on the brick where the hard-disk is replaced.
    To handle this situation gracefully, client xlator is enhanced
    to perform finodelk, fxattrop, writev, readv using anonymous fds
    if the file is yet to be re-opened. If the fop succeeds then client
    xlator attempts re-open.

    fuse-bridge: fix some breakages from lock migration patch
    
    - do not attempt lock migration if no locks were ever acquired on
      an fd.
    
    - fix fd_lk_ctx_t ref leak during fd migration
    
    - remove spurious fd_unref() (probably added to compensate for
      the fd_ref leak in syncop_open_cbk)
    
    - remove @newfdptr out-param which makes fd ref management really
      tricky (and currently refs were unmanaged for the out-param).
      Instead acquire ref and unref within lock migration function.

    cluster/afr: if a subvolume is down wind the lock request to next
    
    When one of the subvolume is down, then lock request is not attempted
    on that subvolume and move on to the next subvolume.
    
    /* skip over children that are down */
                    while ((child_index < priv->child_count)

                            child_index++;
    
    In the above case if there are 2 subvolumes and 2nd subvolume is down (subvolume
    1 from afr's view), then after attempting lock on 1st child (i.e subvolume 0)
    child index is calculated to be 1. But since the 2nd child is down child_index
    is incremented to 2 as per the above logic and lock request is STACK_WINDed to
    the child with child_index 2. Since there are only 2 children for afr the child
    (i.e the xlator_t pointer) for child_index will be NULL. The process crashes
    when it dereference the NULL xlator object.

    cluster/afr: Change order of unwind, resume for writev
    
    Generally inode-write fops do transaction.unwind then
    transaction.resume, but writev needs to make sure that
    delayed post-op frame is placed in fdctx before unwind
    happens. This prevents the race of flush doing the
    changelog wakeup first in fuse thread and then this
    writev placing its delayed post-op frame in fdctx.
    This helps flush make sure all the delayed post-ops are
    completed.

    quick-read: various fixes
    
    - initialize xdata in qr_lookup even if it was NULL from top. This
      allows qr to do its job even if lookup originated from fuse-resolve.c
    
    - extend test cases to include 1 second delay and retry
    
    - fix bug while checking condition for cached unwind
    
      qr_readv_cached() unwinds if op_ret > 0. Therefore qr_readv()
      must wind to subvol only if !(op_ret > 0) (i.e, op_ret <= 0).
    
    - qr_readv_cached() is using uninitialized @conf pointer. Thanks

    tests: skip time consuming mock builds for code-only changes
    
    tests/basic/rpm.t takes a bulk of the time for the regression tests.
    Often the building of the rpm is not affected at all and therefor the
    tests does not add any value.
    
    With this change the rpmbuild/mock test will only be run when some
    changes affect the build system. Changes affecting 'tests/', 'doc/',
    '*.py', *.c' and '*.h' do not trigger the test anymore.

    socket: null out priv->ssl_ssl on disconnect
    
    This prevents problems when a socket transport is reused for a non-SSL
    connection (e.g. glusterd portmapper) after having been used for an SSL
    connection (e.g. a brick).  In that case, ssl_ssl will still be non-null from
    the first connection, even though the structure it points to has actually been
    freed.
    
    I'm not sure why/how we would reuse a socket transport in this way (the case of
    SSL after non-SSL has been common for a long time) but recent glusterd changes
    seem to have had that effect.

    performance/md-cache: add force-readdirp flag to make readdirp configurable
    
    md-cache currently transforms all readdir fops into readdirp fops.
    This patch creates the 'force-readdirp' configuration flag to
    provide control over this behavior. force-readdirp is enabled by
    default to maintain current default behavior.

    This is a minor latency optimization to the readdirp path in
    storage/posix. During a recursive list, we hit this codepath with
    an empty list once per high-level directory to read when end of
    directory is reached. Skip constructing hpath, since we don't do
    anything with it in this case.

    replicate: fix lock counting in blocking lock path
    
    As of http://review.gluster.org/2828, the blocking lock code
    path's condition for checking completion of locking atempt is
    broken. The condition -
    
    	if ((child_index == priv->child_count) || ...)
    
    and
    
    	if ((child_index == priv->child_count) && ...)
    
    which is retained to check completion of blocking lock attempts
    for DATA/METADATA transaction will _always_ fail because a few
    lines above we have -
    
          child_index = cookie % priv->child_count;
    
    So child_index will never equal priv->child_count. This leaves
    the correctness at the mercy of the next part of the
    conditional -
    
    	.. (int_lock->lock_count == int_lock->lk_expected_count) ..
    
    This "works" as long as no server went down during the transaction.
    
    If a server goes down in the middle of the transaction, then this
    condition also fails, and the code wraps around and starts a
    blocking lock attempt loop all the way again from from the first server.
    This results in double locks getting acquired on those servers, and
    eventually the second condition gets hit (first condition is _never_
    hit) and we come out of locking phase.
    
    During unlock phase we perform only one unlock per server leaving the
    other lock "leaked" forever.

    cluster/distribute: get_layout should account only available subvols
    
    The earlier logic used to check if (layout-spread-count <= subvol_cnt -
    decommissioned bricks). With this if a subvol was down, and layout-spread was >
    upsubvols, a mkdir ended up creating holes in the layout.
    
    The fix is to consider only the combination of subvols which are usable (not
    down or not decommissioned).

    afr: Modified book-keeping structures for entrylks
    
    * There are upto 3 entry lockees that may be needed to perform
      entrylk'ing in posix dir-write operations.
    
    * For eg, rmdir ("/a/b") needs to acquire locks on two entities,
      - entrylk ("/a", "b")
      - entrylk ("/a/b", null)
    
    * Changed existing entrylk/rename/selfheal (entrylk) transactions
      to use the new book-keeping structures
    
    * Fixed few issues in afr_trace_entry_lk{in,out} functions. Tracing is now
      aware of the new entry lockee structure.
    
    Implementation notes:
    * Changed 'cookie' sent in stack_wind to encode lockee_entity_no
      and subvol_no.
    
      cookie is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= cookie < replica_count,
      When more than one lock is being acquired across the subvolumes,
      cookie % replica_count gives the subvol_no
      cookie / replica_count gives the lockee_entity_no.

    cluster/afr: Link inode only on lookup
    
    Problem:
    When "gluster volume heal <volname> info is executed, crawl's
    process_entry is not going to populate iatt structure so the
    iatt's gfid will be empty. So inode_links are failing.
    
    Fix:
    inode_link should be done only after lookup i.e. when heal is
    performed. So moved the inode_link related code to just after
    the lookup which is triggered when self-heal is done.
    
    Tests:
    The testcase that gives this issue does not give the inode-link
    failures anymore. glustershd heal, info commands are working as
    expected.
    Wrote basic automation tests for proactive-self-heal-daemon

    build: glusterfs-server should own known files under /var/lib/glusterd
    
    In continuation of Change-Id Ib1df8da7e8abdcd3edece45bd39fe238f28838f1
    there are more files that should be owned by the glusterfs-server
    package.
    
    Note that starting glusterd, doing some peer-probes and creating volumes
    will create additional run-time files under /var/lib/glusterd. The
    filenames depend on the volumes that are created, and that prevents
    packages from knowing (and owning) them in advance. It seems common
    practice to leave files untouched under /var/lib/<app>.
    
    It would be okay to remove files generated by the package itself, but we
    should not remove files generated by other packages, or files that have
    been created by users manually. I do not see a way to detect files
    generated by gluster* applications and remove only these. Keeping the
    runtime files under /var/lib/glusterd (which do not have predictive
    names) is safe and they should not require much space anyway.

    cluster/afr: Disable delayed post op when eager-lock is off
    
    Problem:
    When eager-lock is disabled, inodelks for write-fops on same
    fd conflict with each other. If eager-lock is disabled but
    delayed post-op is enabled then each write fop's inodelk unlock
    waits for post-op-delay-secs. So the conflicting write fop
    acquires inodelk after post-op-delay-secs. This results in
    post-op-delay-secs delay for every write fop on the fd for
    sequential writes (Ex: dd).
    
    Fix:
    Disable delayed-post-op when eager-lock is off.

    glusterd: log changes in volume stop (and in op sm codepath)
    
    This patch makes log changes mostly in the op state machine as also
    in volume stop codepath of glusterd.
    
    Changes made:
    
    * Moved log level from INFO to DEBUG, of log messages on the various
      state transitions within a transaction.
      For example, messages of the following kind:
      a. "Sent op req to <n> peers"
      b. "Received LOCK from uuid: <peer-uuid>", etc.
    
    * Changed some of the log messages to give as much information as
      available in case of failure.
    
    * Added logs to identify on which machine lock/stage/commit failed.
    
    * Quite a few s/THIS/this changes.
    
    Also, with this change, log changes in all other volume ops
    should (hopefully) boil down to modifying the respective logs in
    handler, stage and commit (and brick ops in some cases).

    glusterd: replace obsolete /usr/local reference for remote ssh/gsyncd

    The comments in the bzs are a bit obtuse and/or vague. As near as I
    can make out we had, for a while, a "convenience symlink" to or from
    /usr/local/libexec/gsyncd, which no longer exists.
    
    And, lacking any comments in the code, I gather this is some sort of
    fallback or failsafe logic: if the first, normal attempt to invoke gsyncd
    fails then an attempt is made to ssh to the box and invoke it.
    
    In any event, there's nothing in /usr/local/... so it's unquestionably
    wrong to try to invoke anything there.

    afr: conditionally prioritize EIO errors over ENOENT
    
    The most important errno logic historically only prioritized ESTALE
    over ENOENT. Commit c8c0942d added EIO prioritization over ENOENT
    to ensure that split-brain was reported when it occurs in
    conjunction with bricks missing the file entry. The unintended side
    effect of this change is that (non split-brain) EIO errors reported
    from the bricks themselves are now reported to the client when the
    expectation is that afr should squash said errors in favor of
    marking the file inconsistent.
    
    The high-level problem is that EIO is overloaded with different
    meanings from different contexts. This commit adds an eio parameter
    to the errno priority logic to conditionally flag when EIO is of
    higher priority and should be propagated to the client.

    afr: replace afr_more_important_error with afr_most_important_error
    
    afr_more_important_error() is written to return whether a new errno
    should override an existing errno for high-level operations that
    could span multiple sub-operations. It specifically prioritizes
    ESTALE over EIO over ENOENT, and otherwise defaults to the latest
    error passed having priority.
    
    This change preserves current behavior, but rewrites the logic to
    return the higher priority error of the existing and new errno. The
    purpose of the change is to make the logic a bit more clear and set
    the stage for future changes to make the logic flexible based on
    context.

    glusterd: Don't persist enable-pump in volinfo->dict
    
    - enable-pump option in the pump xlator is set during a replace-brick
      session. This was persisted in the volinfo->dict for volume file
      generation.
      It has two 'harmful' side-effects,
      a) It would lead to volinfo cksum divergence among peers in
         cluster (for the same version no.) during a replace-brick session.
    
      b) "enable-pump" key would appear in "gluster volume info VOLNAME".
         This key is used internally in volume file generation code to
         optionally load the pump xlator in the source brick. It is _not_
         an volume option.

    Fix format security errors with hardening build flags
    
    These problems were found while building with the hardening options used
    by Debian. In order to prevent introducing new unsafe constructs, the
    options -Wformat" and -Werror=format-security are addeded to the CFLAGS
    by configure.ac if the compiler supports them.
    
    Also, a small spelling fix in posix-aio.c is included.

    protocol/server: do server_connection_put only if bound_xl is NULL
    
    If getting bound_xl fails, then while putting the connection back we
    should also check for bound_xl pointer for NULL apart from the op_ret
    and the connection object. We were checking just op_ret and conn pointer
    till now and if the mount from a machine is not allowed as auth.allow
    did not permit it, then also we were destroying the connection object.

    glusterd, cli: Task id's for async tasks
    
    This patch introduces task-id's for async tasks like rebalance, remove-brick and
    replace-brick. An id is generated for each task when it is started and displayed
    to the user in cli output. The status of running tasks is also included in the
    output of "volume status" along with its id, so that a user can easily track the
    progress of an async task.
    
    Also,
     * added tests for this feature into the regression test suite.
     * added a python script for creating files, 'create-files.py', courtesy
       Vijaykumar Koppad (vkoppad@redhat.com) into the test suite.
    
    This patch reverts the revert commit 698deb33d731df6de84da8ae8ee4045e1543a168.

    protocol/server: Do not access key after GF_FREE in _delete_auth_opt()
    
    PROBLEMS:
    
    1.'key' becomes a dangling pointer after the first call to dict_del()
       returns, in _delete_auth_opt(). Therefore, the second call to
       fnmatch() is made with 'key' pointing to deallocated space.
    
    2. Also, the name _delete_auth_opt seems to suggest that the function
       is intended to match and delete "auth" options from the dictionary.
       But it winds up deleting all the options irrespective of whether
       the pattern match was successful or not. The same is true with
       _copy_auth_opt().
    
    FIX:
    
    Changed _delete_auth_opt() to delete the key ONLY if it matches either
    of the two patterns (auth.addr.*.allow and auth.addr.*.reject).
    Similarly, changed _copy_auth_opt() along the same lines.

Author: Niels de Vos <ndevos@redhat.com>
Date:   Wed Dec 19 16:40:11 2012 +0100

    tests: let basic/rpm.t cleanup after itself when not in DEBUG-mode
    
    The temporary working directory unders /var/tmp is not cleaned when
    debugging of the test is disabled. The logic should be the othetr way
    around.
    
    With this correction, the output while running is reduced as well.
    Nothing of the output contains useful information and clutters the
    testing output for no reason.

    The REST API for listing objects in a container does not require that the list

    object-storage: a set of cleanups to DiskFile
    
    Here are a set of cleanups for things noticed while working on the

      * Remove unused constants, adding a constant for default disk chunk
        size
    
      * Document missing logger parameter from constructor
    
      * Add iter_hook paramater to constructor in anticipation of 1.7.4
        support
    
      * Add back meta_file field even though it is not used in our version
        of the constructor for paranoid compatibility
    
      * Remove is_valid field as it is not referenced anywhere, and it is
        not a field of the super class
    
      * Rename fields only used internally by DiskFile with leading
        underscores
    
      * Convert to using os.path.join() instead of hard coded '/'
        references
    
      * Use data_file field where possible
    
      * Assert that put_metadata() will only work when the file exists
    
      * Remove update_object() method since it is identical to
        put_metadata() and a direct write will suffice
    
      * Create the directory object only if it does not exist when a
        marker directory is requested

    object-storage: Initial unittest of DiskFile class
    
    If we had this ahead of time, we could have avoided the errors that
    were encountered leading to the fix-account-mapping fix (see
    http://review.gluster.org/4222).
    
    This represents 100% coverage of the DiskFile module, but the coverage
    report says otherwise, unfortunately. That is because the put() method
    invokes eventlets during the test run, and coverage is not able to
    accurately track the coverage lines properly. If one comments out the
    "tpool.execute()" line in DiskFile.put() the coverage report then
    reports 100% for the DiskFile module.
    
    Additionally, we changed DiskFile.put() in four ways that should not
    change its behavior:
    
      1. Comments were added to explain various code paths and mark
         potential issues / fixes
    
      2. It no longer returns a boolean value, matching the behavior of
         swift.obj.server.DiskFile.put()
    
      3. It no longer logs a message when it detects a directory that
         already exists, instead is raises an exception
    
         We believe this is okay because we cannot find a code path that
         would lead to his condition. As a result, it makes it easier to
         test all the code paths in that routine.
    
      4. It no longer logs a message when create_dir_object() fails, since
         create_dir_object() raises an exception on failure only
    
         We also modified create_dir_object() to not return a boolean as a
         result of the above behavior.
    
    Note that by implementing these tests up to this point we found three
    code paths that would have failed if encountered due to missing
    imports. We also made changes to the DiskFile module to make it a bit
    easier to test, also eliminating an extra stat system call when
    deleting directory objects.

    cluster/dht: Add "afr.readdir-failover=off" option the rebalance process
    
    By failing over readdir (default behaviour), rebalance could get duplicate
    files, as readdir would re-read from offset 0. Rebalance should not attempt
    to migrate these files again.
    
    Additionally, we need to handle these cases as failure in rebalance crawl.
    
    No test case provided, as we cannot determine the read child in afr.

    A peer probe with peers with differing op-versions or with unresolvable
    addresses would not reply to the cli with the error.
    This regression was caused by some changes introduced into
    glusterd_peer_rpc_notify(), which caused the cli reply path not to be executed.

    build: include OCF resource agents by default and package them
    
    This change introduces a glusterfs-resource-agents sub-package that
    contains the Open Cluster Framework (OCF) Resource Agents (RA). It also
    changes the build infrastructure to include the RA by default, making
    them available for anyone who is interested in using them with a OCF
    compatible Hight-Availability solution like Pacemaker.
    
    Build the RPMs without RA:
    $ make dist && rpmbuild -ta --without ocf *.gz
    
    Build the RPMs with RA (default):
    $ make dist && rpmbuild -ta *.gz
    
    There is no need to run ./autogen.sh from within the .spec, the whole
    autotools infrastructure is included in the 'make dist' tarball already.
    
    This also adds a test-case which builds the rpms with mock for the
    latest two EPEL releases.

    glusterd: log appropriate message when locking fails
    
    PROBLEM:
    
    When a transaction is already in progress, and the user tries to
    execute another glusterd operation, the second operation fails as
    glusterd fails to acquire lock. But to the user, a message like
    "Operation failed" does not give ample information about why the
    operation failed.
    
    FIX:
    
    Made glusterd_op_txn_begin use and initialise error string, which is
    needed to capture failure in the "lock" phase.
    
    Also made gd_sync_task_begin set error string appropriately when
    locking fails.
    
    In the process, I had to introduce error string in some glusterd_handle_*
    functions. And because I introduced error string in these handlers, I
    decided to also set them in places where these handlers could possibly
    fail.
    
    HOW I TESTED IT:
    
    For want of a better idea, I "commented out" the call to
    "glusterd_unlock", recompiled glusterd and ran two glusterd volume
    operations, one after the other. The second operation fails with the
    message "Another transaction is in progress. Please try again after
    sometime." as expected.
    
    The tests were performed on two volume ops : one of them
    synctask'ized (volume start) and the other NOT (volume create).

    rpcsvc: do a 'iobuf_ref()' on buffer while synctaskizing actor
    
    Starting rpc actors using synctask causes rpcsvc to return before the actor
    actually finishes its actions. This would cause the buffer to be unreffed by
    socket and be possibly reused, before the actor used it, leading to failures
    in the actor.
    This patch makes rpcsvc take a ref on the buffer when synctaskizing the actor
    and store it in the request structure, and then later unref it when the request
    structure is destroyed. This makes sure that the buffer is not reused before the
    actor has finished.

    object-storage: fix account mapping
    
    Fix the account mapping so that we always use what is provided by the request.
    
    With this fix, "/mnt/gluster-object/AUTH_ufo0" directory hierachies won't be
    created. But this fix does not restore the one-to-one account to gluster
    volume name mapping.
    
    When the user runs the /usr/bin/gluster-swift-gen-builders script, it still
    only allows one cluster volume, and that is the only volume that is used. So
    the account names are effectively ignored. A future set of changes will
    address that problem.

    cluster/afr: mark new entry changelog for create/mknod failures
    
    Problem:
    When create/mknod fails on some of the nodes, appropriate pending
    data/metadata changelogs are not assigned. This was not considered
    to be an issue because entry self-heal would do the assigning of
    appropriate changelog after creating new entries. But using
    the combination of rebalance and remove brick we can construct a
    case where a file with same name and gfid can be created in a dir
    with different data and link-to xattr without any changelog.
    
    Fix:
    When a create/mknod failure is observed mark the appropriate
    changelog on the new file created.

    afr: use data trylock mode in read/write self-heal trigger paths
    
    Self-heal data lock contention between clients and glustershd
    instances can lead to long wait and user response times if the
    client ends up pending its lock on glustershd self-heal of a large
    file. We have reports of guest vm instances going completely
    unresponsive during self-heal of virtual disk images.
    
    Optimize the read/write self-heal trigger codepath
    (i.e., afr_open_fd_fix()) to trylock for self-heal and skip the
    self-heal otherwise to minimize the likelihood of a running/active
    guest of competing with glustershd on arrival of a brick. Note that
    lock contention is still possible from the client (e.g., via
    lookup).

    glusterd: add "volume label" command
    
    This command is necessary when the local disk/filesystem containing a brick
    is unexpectedly lost and then recreated.  Since 961bc80c, trying to start
    the brick will fail because the trusted.glusterfs.volume-id xattr is
    missing, and if we can't start it then we can't replace-brick or self-heal
    so we're stuck in a permanently degraded state.  This command provides a
    way to label the empty brick with the proper volume ID so that further
    repair actions become possible.

    geo-rep / gsyncd: play nicely with peer multiplexing when setting a checkpoint
    
    The gsyncd invocation that instruments the "geo-rep config" command is
    multiplexed over peers to ensure the uniformity of configuration.
    In general, that works well, but checkpoint setting is a special case,
    because (unlike other instances of config-set) it is logged (as recording
    of checkpoint events is part of the feature).
    
    Problem is that the path components leading to the log file are
    created only on the original node, where gsyncd was started.
    Therefore the logging attempt will fail on the other nodes.
    
    Fix: ignore if opening the logfile on behalf of checkpoint setting
    fails with ENOENT.

    nfs: do opendir for "naked" readdirp to force self-heal checks
    
    Instead of an opendir, the first thing the Linux NFS client usually sends
    us is a readdirp at offset zero, effectively bypassing our self-heal checks.
    Detect this condition and issue our own opendir to compensate.

    cluster/afr: Provide option to disable readdir failover
    
    In a replica pair unlike files, directories may not have their
    content in same order, so readdir for same (offset, size) may
    not give same entries on both the sobvolumes of replica pair.
    Switching over from one subvolume to another may not be a good
    idea sometimes. It may lead to duplicate entries or fewer entries
    or both. This patch provides a way to disable readdir-failover
    so that applications like rebalance can retry if they want to.

    mgmt/glusterd: Consider nodesvc to be running after online
    
    Definition of online in the message below is that the
    RPC_CLNT_CONNECT event arrives for the nfs/self-heal-daemon process.
    
    For automated tests, sometimes the script needs to wait until
    self-heal-daemon comes online, so that the relevant
    commands can be executed. Gluster volume status before this change
    printed whether the self-heal-daemon is running or not based on the
    lock availability on the pidfile. But there is a small window where
    the lock on pid file is present but the process is still not
    online. So the commands that were depending on this kept failing in
    the test script.

    * Most of the volume related commands are updated to handle BD xlator,
      like add-brick, heal-brick etc refuse to work when volume is BD xlator

    * Only one VG (ie brick) can be specified for BD xlator during volume

    xlators: Add Block Device(BD) backend translator
    
    Add a new server storage xlator 'bd mapper'. Intention of this xlator is
    to add block device backend support to gluster. It exports block devices
    as regular files to the gluster client.
    
    The immediate goal of this translator is to use logical volumes to
    store VM images and expose them as files to QEMU/KVM.
    
    Given Volume group is represented as directory and its logical
    volumes as files.
    
    By exporting LUNs/LVs as regular files, it becomes possible to:
    * Associate each VM to a LV/LUN
    * Use file system commands like cp to take copy of VM images
    * Create linked clones of VM  by doing LV snapshot at server
    side
    * Implement thin provisioning by developing a qcow2 translator
    
    As of now this patchset maps only logical volumes. BD Mapper volume
    file specifies which Volume group to export to the client. BD xlator
    exports the volume group as a directory and all logical volumes under that
    as regular files.
    
    BD xlator uses lvm2-devel APIs for getting the list of Volume Groups
    and Logical Volumes in the system.
    
    The eventual goal of this work is to support thin provisioning,
    snapshot, copy etc of VM images seamlessly in glusterfs storage environment

    afr: send unique dict_t instances to replicas in self-heal fxattrop
    
    afr_sh_data_fxattrop() currently allocates and sends a single xattr
    dict_t instance to each replica. The callback codepath references
    the returned object in the self-heal in-memory state for the
    particular replica. If storage/posix is in the same address-space
    (i.e., running a single glusterfs client with a fuse->afr->posix
    graph), the same object is modified and returned for each child,
    causing corrupted in-memory state and afr xattrs.
    
    Allocate and send independent xattr dict_t's for each replica. This
    allows self-heal to work correctly in a single address-space
    graph.

    afr: handle short writes in afr_writev_wind and self-heal to avoid corruption
    
    The current failure to handle short writes on writev fops leaves
    us open to file corruption. A short write on a user request is
    ignored and leaves replicas in an inconsistent state. A short write
    during a self-heal is ignored and incorrectly marks the files as
    consistent if the heal completes.
    
    Modify user writev handling to return the best case return value
    from each of the replicas. Short writes that occur relative to this
    value are marked as failed and will require a heal. Modify
    self-heal to set an error on a short write and abort the heal.

    glusterd, cli: implement gluster system uuid reset command
    
    A commonly faced problem among glusterfs users is: after a fresh
    installation of glusterfs in a virtual machine, the VM image is
    cloned to make multiple instances of the server. This breaks
    glusterd because right after glusterfs installation on the first
    boot glusterd would have created the node UUID and this gets
    inherited into the clone. The result is wierd behavior at the time
    of peer probe where glusterd does not (yet) deal with UUID
    collisions in a user friendly way.
    
    To handle it gluster peer reset command is implemented which upon
    execution changes the uuid of local glusterd.

    features/locks: implement fgetxattr and fsetxattr
    
    implement xattrs for GF_XATTR_LOCKINFO_KEY, which will be used
    for posix-locks migration from old to new graph after a switch.
    
    fgetxattr (fd, GF_XATTR_LOCKINFO_KEY) will return a dict.
    This dict has a serialized dict stored for key
    GF_XATTR_LOCKINFO_KEY. This serialized dict in turn has fdnum
    value of locks acquired on this fd with modified pathinfo
    (containing hostname and base directory components) as key.
    
    fsetxattr (newfd, GF_XATTR_LOCKINFO_KEY, dict) has following
    semantics. dict can be the result of a previous fgetxattr with
    GF_XATTR_LOCKINFO_KEY. In that case, a dict_get on dict
    constructed using serialized buffer is done on modified pathinfo
    as key. If a value is got, that value is treated as fdnum and for
    every lock l on newfd->inode we do,
          if (l->fdnum == fdnum) {
             l->fdnum = fd_fdnum (newfd);
             l->transport = <connection identifier of connection on which fsetxattr came>;

    cluster/afr: handle GF_XATTR_LOCKINFO_KEY appropriately.
    
    values from all children need to be aggregated into a dictionary
    and serialized buffer of this aggregated dictionary has to be
    the value of GF_XATTR_LOCKINFO_KEY in the dict sent as a result of
    fgetxattr.

    replicate: don't stop checking xattrs because one was absent
    
    The functional issue is described by the subject line.  This patch also
    addresses several efficiency/structure issues, such as...
    
    * Calling dict_set_ptr once for each txn type, instead of once overall.
    
    * Calling afr_index_for_transaction_type once per iteration instead of
      once per call (or better yet zero since the conversion is unnecessary).
    
    * Implementation of inner functions in a different file than their one
      caller, creating a spurious header-file dependency.

    Cluster/afr: Fix output for gluster volume heal vn info healed
    
    Problem:
    Whenever gluster volume heal vol full command is executed, the entries
    stored in the circual buffer for sh->healed are added in the dictionary
    in the _crawl_post_sh_action function irrespective of whether actual self heal
    (due to non-zero values in chage log) takes place or not.
    
    Fix:
    Value of key (actual-sh-done) will be set to 1 whenever self heal takes place
    due to non-zero change log values and if for some FOP self heal daemon finds
    that no self heal required after examining the pending matrix, the value will
    be 0.

    object-storage: Add a sorted list comparison to test
    
    After the commit b0cb7aaf for bz#870589, which adds 2 tarballs
    with layout patterns, Swift tests sometimes fail (depending on the
    kind of filesystem they are running at and the phase of the moon).
    
    As pattern tarball is unpacked, the underlying filesystem is free
    to return directory listings in any order, and straightforward use
    of '==' operator fails. As it turns out, one of the two comparisons
    had set() applied to the list already. So, add it to the other one.

    perf/io-threads: least-rate-limit least priority throttling
    
    The 'least-rate-limit' io-threads translator option enables
    throttling of least priority operations. This is initially intended
    as a debug/diagnostic tool for users who might experience
    overloaded servers via background activity (i.e., self-heal).
    
    least-rate-limit defines the maximum number of least priority
    operations the io-threads translator will dequeue in one second.
    If the specified rate limit is met, the worker threads sleep for
    the minimal amount of time before the next least priority operation
    becomes available (or until a new request arrives).
    
    The requests/second metric is generic and relative to a variety of
    factors involved with a background operation (server, storage,
    etc.). The most recent measured rate ("cached least rate") is added
    to the io-threads state dump content (kill -USR1) to serve as a
    reference point to throttle background activity under particular
    conditions.

    type is set. Default transaction type is DATA so all transactions

    Move the code that takes lk-owner decision after the transaction
    type is set.
    
    Test:
    Checked that the transaction type is set properly in gdb at
    the time of the lk-owner decision.

    posix: Fix volume will not start if brick has no volume-id attribute
    
    Problem:
    If the extended attribute (trusted.glusterfs.volume-id) of a brick  is
    absent and <gluster volume start volume-name> command is executed then
    curretly volume-id from the volume file will be set as an extended attribute of
    the brick and volume will get started.
    But if setup is such that brick is used as a mount point and before
    executing the <gluster volume start volume-name> command, nothing is mounted on
    the brick then all the file operations will take place at the brick but actual
    intention of the brick is to be used as mount point only.
    
    FIX:
    Do not start the volume if extended attribute (trusted.glusterfs.volume-id)
    is set absent.

    storage/posix: Make rchecksum O_DIRECT friendly
    
    Problem:
    When posix-aio is enabled to perform aio fd is set with O_DIRECT
    whenever possible in read, writev fops. Rchecksum does not take
    this into account. If either offset/size/memory-buf passed to
    pread in rchecksum fop is not aligned, pread fails with EINVAL.
    
    Fix:
    Before doing pread necessary O_DIRECT manipulation is done when
    aio is enabled. Memory buffer passed to pread is now page-aligned.
    
    Test:
    1) Create replica volume with aio enabled.
    2) dd if=/dev/urandom of=a bs=1M count=1
    3) kill one of the bricks in the replica pair
    4) dd if=/dev/urandom of=a bs=1M count=1
    5) bring back the brick. Self-heal succeeds after the change.
    
    The test above checks both rchecksum, writev fops that were
    changed in this patch.

    tests: make _EXPECT handle more cases
    
    First issue is that _EXPECT wasn't handling args with spaces correctly. This
    was fixed by enclosing the entire expected-value expression in double quotes
    with a simple backslash escape for the end-of-line dollar sign.
    
    Second issue is that we were throwing away potentially useful debug
    information. Fixed by using egrep's -q option to suppress output, and
    eliminating redirections so that we can see any stderr output related to a
    script error.

    fuse: handle mountflags properly
    
    The internal mount API had no access to the generic
    mountflags used by mount(2).
    
    Thus the "ro" mount option that needs to be passed down to mount(2) as
    as a mountflag was incorrectly mangled into the fuse-specific mount
    parameter string (cf. http://review.gluster.com/655).
    
    This commit fixes the internal API and the "ro" issue. It also adds a
    check for the "rw" and "ro" mount options in tests/basic/mount.t.
    
    Thanks to Csaba Henk (csaba@) for suggestions and proposing an updated
    patch.

    object-storage: final changes to remove swift diff
    
    Final set of changes to remove the diffs carried to make UFO work with
    OpenStack Swift. The code is now a complete layering on top of OpenStack Swift
    where we either "monkey patch" or subclass as necessary.
    
    See BZ 870589 (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=870589).
    
    There are a lot of changes here due for the most part to rearranging the
    directory hierarchy to have create a proper python module hierarchy under the
    "gluster" namespace. Plugin references have been removed. The differences that
    used to be in the swift.diff file are now replaced with server implementations
    for account, container, object, and proxy that subclass the swift versions.
    
    Additionally, the plugins/conf directory has been moved to the "etc"
    directory, and the plugins/bin directory promoted a level.
    
    Unit tests pass.
    
    A new setup.py file is provided so that the install process can use it for
    creating all the necessary python install infrastructure (eggs and paste
    support).
    
    A new RPM spec file is provided which to properly install the new code, and
    the sample configuration files have been modified to reference the new python
    egg.

    object-storage: refactor to use swift devices
    
    Refactor code to use the devices configuration file setting for account,
    container, and object servers, dropping mount_path from the fs.conf file, and
    constructing new account, container and object server rings.
    
    This removes the next to last set of diffs in the swift diff file. See BZ
    870589 (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=870589).
    
    The key to the change is the dropping of the pre-built account, container and
    object rings, instead providing a script that will generate them for the user
    given the gluster volume name in use. In addition, we override the Swift
    check_mount() method and replace it with Gluster's which attempts to
    "auto-mount" if it is not already mounted.
    
    The following is an enumeration of the changes contained in this refactoring:
    
        * The refactoring to override the Swift check_mount() involved condensing
          a lot of code, removing redundancies and simplifying methods across a
          number of modules
    
        * Drop checking the mount point in the low level DiskDir, DiskAccount and
          DiskFile objects now that Swift's normal mount checking is used, and
          enable it by default in the template configuration file
    
        * Add missing get_container_timestamp() method for DiskAccount objects
    
        * Fix the plugin RPM spec file to provide the new ring builders, and while
          we were at it, finally fix the over-writing of the configuration files
          on install
    
        * Bug fixes
    
            * The monkey patched version of check_object_creation was not working
              correctly due to a missing import of HTTPBadRequest and a bad
              reference to validate_obj_name_component()
    
            * Only have the utils module import the plugins constraints module for
              the side effect of monkey patching if gluster is enabled
    
            * Removed the db_file.db file in the tree since it is created on the
              fly
    
            * Updated 2011 copyright notices to 2012

    object-storage: swift-diff removal: hide obj only
    
    Towards swift-diff removal: hide object_only behavior inside DiskDir class
    objects. See BZ 870589 (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=870589)
    
    One of the last few reasons for having the swift diff is the need to update
    the account and container information from the file system when the
    configuration is not for object-only use (meaning, other updates to the file
    system can come from clients other than UFO, which means UFO currently has to
    generate the necessary metadata for each request instead of caching it).
    
    This change moves that logic into the DiskDir class methods so that the
    container and account server code does not have to track that.

        * Remove the redundant update_account() method in the DiskCommon base
          class, since the update_container() method in DiskDir performs the exact
          same functionality
    
        * Remove the initialization of variables ahead of assignments in two
          cases, and also move the initialization of the list variables closer to
          where they are used
    
        * Collapse the imports from swift.plugins.utils into one statement
    
        * Use a temporary directory for the db_file.db when we find ourselves in a
          unit test environment

    help.
    
    Also added the ability to run the Swift tree unit tests with gluster

    glusterd: Fixed glusterd crash in volume add-brick
    
    PROBLEMS:
    
    a. glusterd crashes when add-brick operation fails on the machine other
       than the originator, owing to double free done on op_errstr:
       once in glusterd_op_begin_synctask and once through a dict unref on
       req_dict in gd_sync_task_begin.
    
    b. In gd_sync_task_begin, there's no need to place the error string
       in the dictionary, when it is never retrieved and used elsewhere.
    
    c. Command execution status is not logged into .cmd_log_history.
    
    FIX:
    
    For (a) and (b): Knocked off code that places the error string in req_dict.
    That way, both the problems are solved.
    
    For (b), passed op_ctx to glusterd_op_send_cli_response as it is needed to
    extract the command string before logging.

    object-storage: remove glusterfs filter requirement
    
    Fixes https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=870589
    
    Remove the Glusterfs object, transforming it into a module providing module
    data fields (like swift.common.constraints) and module methods for
    mounting/unmounting and access the gluster volume information. As a result, we
    can then remove the glusterfs filter from the pipeline since we no longer need
    to provide the Glusterfs object through all the plugin code paths.
    
    This is one more step closer to removing our dependency on modifying the Swift
    code directly with these changes. See It is also the first step to acknowledging
    that we are not a plugin, but a layering on top of Swift.
    
    The major piece of work here is based on a recognition that the
    plugins/Glusterfs.py module provided a Glusterfs class that instantiated
    instances of an object that always contained the same data from the
    configuration file. The fields of such an object were not being changed and
    were treated as read-only in all cases. Since the object's data was the same
    for all instantiations there was no need to pass the data from the glusterfs
    filter all the way down into the bowels of the Gluster_DiskFile and DiskDir
    objects.
    
    Taking advantage of the nature of that data, we now just have those fields
    read into module variables, and change the Glusterfs object methods into
    module level functions. Much of the changes result from the consequence of
    making that switch from object to module.
    
    Here are a few other changes made along the way:
    
      * Bump the release numbers in the spec files in recognition of these changes
    
      * Create the plugins/fs_utils.py module so that the methods in the
        plugins/Glusterfs.py module don't have to include plugins/utils.py, which
        would create a circular dependency
    
        * Note that this dependency comes from methods in plugins/utils.py
          depending on the module level constructs in plugins/Glusterfs.py so that
          we only store those values in one place
    
      * Changed plugins/DiskDir.py:DiskDir class to not check for, and/or
        optionally create, the /etc/swift/db_file.db at run time, just create it a
        module init time
    
      * Removed the duplicate strip_obj_storage_path() from plugins/DiskDir.py and
        utils.py and move it to the Glusterfs module
    
      * Used os.path.join in plugins/DiskDir.py where possible
    
      * Renamed the .conf files to .conf-gluster so that we don't clobber existing
        config files
    
        * This is not a complete change, as the spec file also needs to be
          modified to avoid the clobbering
    
        * See also https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=865867
    
      * Removed the redundant DIR_TYPE definition in plugins/utils.py
    
      * Removed MOUNT_PATH from plugins/utils.py replacing references with that from
        Glusterfs
    
        * This actually fixes a bug if a user every used a different mount path
          from the default in fs.conf
    
      * Added ASYNCDIR definition to plugins/utils.py until such time as another
        refactoring can rely on the one from swift.obj.server
    
      * Renamed plugins/utils.py's plugin_enabled() function to Gluster_enabled()
    
      * The diffs we carry for Swift are now a bit smaller in that we no longer
        have to add the plugin() method, we don't have to keep a fs_object field
        in these objects, and we can reference the Glusterfs module directly
    
      * Unit tests were modified appropriately, but now need to be run in the
        context of a Swift tree; this is unfortunate, but further refactoring will
        address this

    Reduce the number of stat/fstat system calls made
    
    This address BZ 868086, https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=868086
    
    This refactoring consolidates the code a bit, and uses os.stat calls to get
    all the information in one call when gathering the metadata for an object. The
    five stat system calls (invoked via all the os.path.*() calls) have been
    reduced to one.
    
    We also added a unit test for the one new behavior where get_object_metadata()
    will now throw an OSError exception if it has a problem stat'ing a file that
    exists.

    Further reduce extended attribute reads/writes
    
    More refactoring towards reducing the number of extended attribute
    reads/writes to the file system. See BZ 868120:
        http://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=868120
    
    Basically the redundant routines restore_object, restore_account and
    restore_container have been collapsed to one routine, restore_metadata, which
    will only write out metadata if the new metadata is different from what was
    originally read.
    
    Along with these changes come a set of unit tests for all the functions
    related to the routines that are in this module in the call tree where
    restore_metadata is invoked.

    object-storage: reduce the number of getxattr system calls by one
    
    Initial step towards addressing BZ 865619.
    
    Prior to the patch, reading metadata for a given object or container involves
    at minimum three getxattr system calls for objects that use only one xattr
    key/value pair:
    
        1. (via pyxattr)  getxattr() to see if key exists and get its value
           length (so it can allocate memory for second call below)
        2. (from pyxattr) getxattr() to get actual value data
        3. (via pyxattr)  getxattr() to see if following key exists
    
    For objects and containers that only have to use one xattr key/value pair,
    this patch reduces the number system calls by one. This can be significant
    given that almost every Swift API operation requires reads of the object or
    containers metadata.
    
    This patch is mostly a change to plugins.utils.read_metadata() to try to
    unpickle the accumulated metadata as each key/value pair is read, rather than
    trying to accumulate all the key/value pairs and unpickle at the end. Once we
    get enough data to form the pickle, we no longer keep trying to get more keys,
    even if those keys exist.
    
    The extra keys can exist when the size of the stored metadata shrinks below a
    key threshold. See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=865619 for more
    details.
    
    See also https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=865858.
    
    This patch also adds a unit test infrastructure, and uses it to test with full
    coverage, the read_metadata, write_metadata and clean_metadata functions. As a
    result, we found that an infinite loop would occur in clean_metadata() when an
    unexpected IOError would occur trying to remove a key (this patch contains a
    fix).

    object-storage: Bump size of metadata stored per xattr key
    
    For Gluster, since we require XFS, and XFS has a max metadata value size of 64
    KB, use the increased stored size to reduce the number of system calls, and
    how often we exit and enter the Python interpreter (via calls to pyxattr
    module).
    
    Today, with the hardcoded 254 byte limit per xattr key/value pair, adding a
    couple hundred bytes of user specified metadata can translate to up to three
    xattr key/value pairs (remember that the internal python metadata dictionary
    is pickled first and then stored in chunks in the keys).

    Add OCF compliant resource agents for glusterd and volumes
    
    These resource agents plug glusterd into Open Cluster Framework
    (OCF) compliant cluster resource managers, like Pacemaker.
    
    The glusterd RA is fairly trivial; it simply manages the glusterd daemon
    like any upstart or systemd job would, except that Pacemaker can
    do it in a cluster-aware fashion.
    
    The volume RA is a bit more involved; It starts a volume and monitors
    individual brick's daemons in a cluster aware fashion, recovering bricks
    when their processes fail.
    
    Note that this does NOT imply people would deploy GlusterFS servers
    in pairs, or anything of that nature. Pacemaker has the ability to
    deploy cluster resources as clones, meaning glusterd and volumes would be
    configured as follows in a Pacemaker cluster:
    
    primitive p_glusterd ocf:glusterfs:glusterd \
    	op monitor interval="30"
    primitive p_volume_demo ocf:glusterfs:volume \
    	params volname="demo" \
    	op monitor interval="10"
    clone cl_glusterd p_glusterd \
    	meta interleave="true"
    clone cl_volume_demo p_volume_demo \
    	meta interleave="true" ordered="true"
    colocation c_volume_on_glusterd inf: cl_volume_demo cl_glusterd
    order o_glusterd_before_volume 0: cl_glusterd cl_volume_demo
    
    The cluster status then looks as follows (in a 4-node cluster; note
    the configuration above could be applied, unchanged, to a cluster
    of any number of nodes):

    thus it made remove-brick of stopped/created volume as a failure.

    tests: pre-commit regression tests
    
    Framework for writing test cases to be submitted with patches.
    
    This framework and the test cases get exercised by Jenkins in
    the pre-commit regression test. Jenkins is configured to give
    a +1 verified vote only if the regression test passes without
    failures (which includes test cases added/changed by the patch
    being tested)
    
    Every patch should include a test case (either extensions/changes
    to existing test cases or add new ones, as appropriate). The test
    case should be part of the same commit so that both code and
    test case get reviewed together.
    
    Test cases added are cumulative. Every new patch gets
    tested against its own test case and every test case previously
    added.
    
    A lot of new commits in the near future will be pure test cases
    (with no code change) which will get added in "catch up" mode.
    
    The tool used for implementing test cases is 'prove', and the
    framework itself is modeled similar to the POSIX compliance
    filesystem test suite.
    
    Under the top level directory, a new directory named 'tests/'
    is added. This contains top level classifier directories and
    framework files/scripts.
    
    Functionality tests should be created under a classifier directory
    below 'tests/'. For e.g:
    
      tests/basic/mount.t
      tests/performance/write-behind.t
    
    Bugs which get fixed should include a test case script named
    by the bug id, so that we are guaranteed any new change will
    not bring the issue back. For e.g:
    
      tests/bugs/bug-123456.t
    
    Triggering of regression tests in Jenkins is manual at this point
    as we do not want the entire test suite to run against every
    revision of a patch while it is still in the review/resubmit cycle.

    object-storage: Don't catch generic exceptions around xattr calls
    
    We should really avoid catching generic Exception objects around any of our
    system calls. This simple fix brings this code in line with the other code
    wrapping xattr calls.

    object-storage: Refactor code to reduce Swift diffs carried
    
    The upstream Swift code base contains the following commit which adds the
    ability to modify constraint values using the swift.conf file:
    
     https://github.com/openstack/swift/commit/a2ac5efaa64f57fbbe059066c6c4636dfd0715c2
    
    These changes rely on the above commit being back-ported to Swift 1.4.8 (see
    https://github.com/portante/swift/commit/fc2421b04022ac6bbe9d5014362ec5f99f94c5e0).
    
    As a result, a good number of differences we carry can be removed, since the
    provided swift.conf file now contains the values we need.
    
    Along with these changes, we add middleware to get constraints loaded properly
    (via monkey patching) until subclassing is implemented in a future commit. We
    further simplify the diffs to a minimal set by storing the timestamp in file
    system metadata and moving new files to the plugins/middleware directory.
    
    Note that the original "gluster" middleware was in the swift.diff file, and
    has been renamed to "glusterfs" and moved to the new plugins/middleware
    directory. The "gluster" middleware is now a temporary way to get the
    constraints properly loaded (both of these middleware pieces should disappear
    in future commits when we refactor further to subclass the Swift objects
    instead of patching them).

    syncop: save and restore THIS from the time of context switch
    
    The current yield() code assumes that the point of yielding
    is always in the translator where the synctask was created. This
    can be a problem for nested syncops and/or where syncop is issued
    by a different translator.
    
    So, save the THIS pointer just before swapcontext() and restore
    it right after resuming.

    Remove the test subdirectory diffs ahead of initial refactoring.
    
    A subsequent commit will refactor the changes required of Swift to be much
    more minimal in nature, but does so by relying on an upstream Swift change to
    allow constraint values specified in the swift.conf file (see
    https://github.com/openstack/swift/commit/a2ac5efaa64f57fbbe059066c6c4636dfd0715c2).
    
    As a result, we can remove the test subdirectory diffs and assume that they
    will be present as a result of the upstream patch above.

    Fix BZ 865858: remove unnecessary system calls around xattr ops
    
    The following is a simple refactoring of the read and write metadata methods
    to just make calls to get/set/remove xattr operations instead of trying to
    stat/open/close the file. For a single GET operation, this brings down the
    number of system calls made from 13 to 3 for a file object with no
    significantly sized metadata (meaning, only 1 xattr key/value pair is needed
    to store the metadata).

    rsycn glusterd and bricks of one of the machine gets killed then executing
    gluster volume heal info gives results sporadically.Sometimes it says Number of
    entries are zero and other time it gives different output. When glusterd and
    brick of one of the machine gets killed then at other machine,
    RPC_CLNT_DISCONNECT will get triggered periodically. So it may happen that
    during the execution of gluster volume heal info command, RPC_CLNT_DISCONNECT
    also gets triggered and glusterd will assume that it got a new rpc_disconnet
    notification and glusterd will call the glusterd_op_ac_send_unlock_drain
    function instead of calling the glusterd_op_ac_rcvd_brick_op_acc function which
    is responsible for printing the entries. So because of RCP_CLNT_DISCONNECT
    notification, glusterd will execute functions responsible for
    RPC_CLNT_DISCONNECT(glusterd_op_ac_send_unlock_drain) rather than executing
    functions responsible for gluster volume heal info
    command(glusterd_op_ac_rcvd_brick_op_acc).
    
    FIX:
    Put a condition in for RPC_CLNT_DISCONNECT in the glusterd_peer_rpc_notify
    function so that if RPC_DISCONNECT is triggered for the first for a peer then
    glusterd mark that peer as disconnected so that if RPC_DISCONNET is triggered
    again, because peer is already marked as disconnected, glusterd will not inject
    EVENTR_ACK_DRAIN and prints the Number of entries.

    client-handshake: synchronize config.remote_port setting b/w
    rpc_clnt_reconnect and client_query_portmap_cbk
    
    problem:
    -------
    Theoretically there is a possibility that we could complete
    querying the remote brick's port number before rpc_transport_connect
    can return. If rpc_clnt_reconnect happens to be the caller of
    rpc_transport_connect and we've already got the remote brick's port
    number by the time rpc_transport_connect returns, without synchronization,
    rpc_clnt_connect resets config.remote_port to zero even before we have
    attempted a connection with remote brick.
    
    fix:
    ---
    By making only poll thread do setting and resetting of
    config.remote_port, we avoid the race-condition.

    When the glusterd service is disabled and/or not running, the %post
    scriptlet for the glusterfs-geo-replication sub-package should not start
    glusterd.
    
    To resolve this, an additional condition will only restart glusterd on an
    update ($1 -ge 1) and only when it is running (condrestart).

    cli: Changes and enhancements to XML output
    
    This patch contains several xml related changes which fix some bugs and
    introduce xml output for commands which were missing it. These include,
    * XML output for rebalance & remove-brick status
    * XML output for replace-brick
    * XML output for 'volume status all' in on xml document
    * proper XML output for "volume {create|start|stop|delete}"
    * type & status of a volume in 'volume info' is now given as a string as well
    
    This patch also cleans up the '#if (HAVE_LIB_XML)' sections from the code-base,
    so that it is not littered around.

    build: remove useless explicit -fPIC -shared from
     CFLAGS
    
    libtool will automatically add "-fPIC" to the compiler command line as
    needed, so there is no need to specify it separately.
    
    "-shared" is normally a linker flag and has an odd effect when used with
    libtool --mode=compile, namely that it inhibits production of static
    objects. For that however, using AC_DISABLE_STATIC is a lot simpler.

    fuse: create a new fd during fd-migration.
    
    Migration of fd to new graph involves creation of a new fd
    to be used only for calls sent in that graph.
    
    Earlier approach of using same fd across all graphs, with the
    associated inode always guaranteed to be the one valid in
    currently active graph, had issues because of the broken
    immutability of the association of fd with an inode
    (for the life of fd).
    
    With this patch, there will be a basefd, which the kernel will be
    aware of. This basefd, contains a mapping of an fd which is valid
    in currently active graph.

    common-utils: valid_host_name() should allow (sub)domains starting/ending with a digit
    
    Some (sub)domains start or end with a digit. If this is the case, it
    will not be possible to 'gluster peer probe' hosts in that (sub)domain.
    This is overly restrictive, and RFC 1912 contains a note that describes
    the common use of start/end digits in (sub)domains:
    >
    > Allowable characters in a label for a host name are only ASCII
    > letters, digits, and the `-' character.  Labels may not be all
    > numbers, but may have a leading digit  (e.g., 3com.com).  Labels must
    > end and begin only with a letter or digit.  See [RFC 1035] and [RFC
    > 1123].  (Labels were initially restricted in [RFC 1035] to start with
    > a letter, and some older hosts still reportedly have problems with
    > the relaxation in [RFC 1123].)  Note there are some Internet
    > hostnames which violate this rule (411.org, 1776.com).
    >
    
    This change will also allow (sub)domains to consist out of digits only,
    like the example of 411.org above. It is still not allowed to start or
    and a (sub)domain with a `-' (dash) character.

    linux-aio: fixes while setting O_DIRECT flag
    
    Linux AIO needs O_DIRECT to be set for effective operation. O_DIRECT
    in turn has constraints on when it can work (offset, size alignment)
    
    So use O_DIRECT (unless instructed by application) only when offset
    and size alignments match. Else, io_submit() will happen over
    non-O_DIRECT fd, effectively blocking till the completion of the IO.
    
    Also fix a multithreading bug where detection/setting of O_DIRECT
    for a request was not atomic with io_submit() of that request.

    write-behind: implement causal ordering and other cleanup
    
    Rules of causal ordering implemented:
    
    - If request A arrives after the acknowledgement (to the app,
      i.e, STACK_UNWIND) of another request B, then request B is
      said to have 'caused' request A.
    
    - (corollary) Two requests, which at any point of time, are
      unacknowledged simultaneously in the system can never 'cause'
      each other (wb_inode->gen is based on this)
    
    - If request A is caused by request B, AND request A's region
      has an overlap with request B's region, then then the fulfillment
      of request A is guaranteed to happen after the fulfillment of B.
    
    - FD of origin is not considered for the determination of causal
      ordering.
    
    - Append operation's region is considered the whole file.
    
    Other cleanup:
    
    - wb_file_t not required any more.
    
    - wb_local_t not required any more.
    
    - O_RDONLY fd's operations now go through the queue to make sure
      writes in the requested region get fulfilled before getting
      processed.
    
    - O_SYNC fd's operations now go through the queue to make sure
      previously acknowledged writes on the file (via other fds) are
      fulfilled before getting processed.
    
    - Option to not honor O_SYNC is now removed.
    
    - Option to ignore O_DIRECT is added (useful when running a VM and the
      drive appears with NCQ/TCQ or WCE=1 for the guest.)
    
    - Option to disable_first_nbytes is removed (as the cause of the
      bug which required this was diagnosed to be missing TCP_NODELAY.)
    
    - General cleanup and better conformance to coding style and convention.

    in readdir. More the size of readdir more number of lookups happen
    in parallel. It is observed that it leads to HUGE cpu spikes
    rendering everything else on the system unusable.
    
    Fix:
    Provided the option self-heal-readdir-size to configure the size.
    Default value is at 1KB.

    Checked that the readdirs are happening with the configured value
    in entry-self-heal.

    cli: removed extra dict unrefs and memory leaks
    
    PROBLEMS ADDRESSED:
    a. The following change
          http://review.gluster.com/#change,3948
       introduces extra dict unrefs in cli.
    b. There are instances of memory leak in gf_cli_*_cbk functions.
    
    FIX:
    Problem (a) is fixed by ensuring the dict is ref'd (indirectly at
    the time of creation) and unref'd (in CLI_STACK_DESTROY) ONLY
    once. The following is the rationale behind this approach:
    
       The number of refs and unrefs on dict varies across the different
       commands that use it. The cli thread MUST wait for the
       gf_cli_*_cbks to complete before the frame is destroyed. This
       rules out the need to do extra refs and unrefs in the code path.
    
    Problem (b) is fixed by doing unref on dicts that are created for
    the purpose of unserializing the response but never freed in
    gf_cli_*_cbk functions.

    Volume start cli handler does dict_unref of the dict
    unconditionally. It needs to be unrefed only on failure.
    
    Fix:
    Unref the dict only on failure.
    
    Tests:
    Volume start works fine after the fix.

    protocol/client: quick-reconnect after portmap query
    
    Currently the disconnect after a portmap query is treated like an
    ordinary disconnect and the reconnection attempt (in this case, to
    the brick) is attempted only after 3 secs. This results in a delay
    which is unnecessary.
    
    Mark the disconnection happening because of a successful portmap
    query as needing a 'quick reconnect' to avoid the delay for this
    special case.

    cluster/afr: Trigger heal on local subvols on any child_up
    
    Problem:
    The index in the child that comes online is generally empty
    because the changes would have happened on the other child which
    has been up.  So the sync begins when the other child's poll
    time-out happens (i.e. 10 minutes). The expectation is that the
    sync must be triggered as soon as the connection with any brick
    is established.
    
    Fix:
    Whenever any child_up happens trigger the index self-heal on all
    local children in the replicate subvolume.
    
    Tests:
    1) Checked that the self-heal is triggered on all local children
    whenever any child comes online.
    2) Checked that the volume heal commands are working fine.

    cluster/afr: Wake up post-op on non-co-operative transaction
    
    Problem:
    The problem is observed when kernel untar is done. One file untar
    happens every second. The reason for this is, setattr lock is blocked
    on the prev fd data-transaction full-lock (because of eager-lock).
    Because of post-op-delay the post-op (xattrop + unlock) of the prev
    data-transaction happens after 1 sec.
    Until this the setattr is blocked resulting in performance problems
    in untar.
    
    Fix:
    Whenever an loc data, meta-data transaction comes, it should wakeup
    the prev-post-op on the same process' fd.
    
    Tests:
    The performance problem in untar went away. I put a breakpoint in
    client_finodelk for a 2G file dd and the inodelk is hit only 4 times.
    This confirms that the change does not affect post-op-delay in a
    -ve way.

    glusterd: Fix to log command status at the appropriate time
    
    PROBLEM:
    In the existing implementation, the success/failure of
    execution of a command is decided (and logged) in glusterd
    handler functions. Strictly speaking, the logging mechanism
    must take into account what course the command takes within
    the state machine before concluding whether it succeeded or
    failed.
    
    FIX:
    This patch attempts to fix the above issue for vol commands.
    The format of the log message is as follows:
        for failure:
        <command string> : FAILED : <cause of failure>
        for success:
        <command string> : SUCCESS
    
    APPROACH (in a nutshell):
    
     * The command string is packed into dict at cli and sent to
       glusterd.
     * glusterd logs the command status just before doing a
       "submit_reply", which is called (either directly or
       indirectly via a call to glusterd_op_cli_send_response)
       at 2 places for every vol command:
       i. in handler functions, and
       ii. in glusterd_op_txn_complete
    
    In short, the failure of a command in the handler implies the
    command has indeed failed. However, its success in the handler
    does NOT necessarily mean the command succeeded/will succeed.

    mount/fuse: readdir() should return 32-bit inodes when 'enable-ino32' is used
    
    The glusterfs mount option 'enable-ino32' does not change the behaviour
    of readdir(). fuse_readdir_cbk() uses entry->d_ino directly, and this
    was missed in commit c13823bd16b26bc471d3efb15f63b76fbfdf0309.
    
    By adding the function gf_fuse_fill_dirent(), the fuse_dirent structure
    is filled in a similar way as the fuse_attr structure. This helper uses
    the same function to squash the 64-bit inode in a 32-bit attribute.

    features/marker: if parent inode is NULL, then get it by inode_parent
    
    * If parent inode is NULL (nameless lookups which uses gfid for looking up the
    inode), then try to get it by inode_parent, instead of returning  which results
    in the inode's contribution not being added to the list.
    
    * Prevent exceesive logging while adding the inode's contribution to the list
      if the operation fails. (Check if the inode's gfid is null which indicates
      that the inode is not yet linked to the inode table and hence addition
      of its contribution to the list can fail).

    mount/fuse: treat NULL gfid is a failure in lookup disregarding op_ret
    
    It is not possible to inode_link() with a NULL gfid. If a lookup
    (or any other "entry" op) returns a success but has a NULL gfid,
    then treat it as a failure even if op_ret was 0.
    
    Currently AFR does this when self-healing fails/aborts in certain
    situations (like entrylk acquisition failure, gfid mismatch etc.)
    returning a NULL gfid in struct iatt of lookup_cbk with op_ret = 0.
    Fixing this is an independent patch and fuse-bridge needs to be
    robust against such misformed replies in any case.

    glusterfs SEGV on Fedora 17 from UFO fallocate(2) call
    
    An upload of a file will cause the volume's glusterfs to SEGV
    when it fields a FUSE_FALLOCATE op. Swift inspects libc to determine
    if there is a symbol for fallocate(2) and if so will use it. And
    while the libc in RHEL 6 does have fallocate(2), the version of
    fuse in RHEL 6 does not support fallocate, and things are handled
    gracefully elsewhere (the kernel perhaps?)
    
    N.B. fallocate was added to version 7.19 of fuse. Fedora 17 and
    later (and maybe earlier too) has 7.19. RHEL 6 still has 7.13.
    Glusterfs uses the 7.13 version <linux/fuse.h>
    (in contrib/fuse-include/fuse_kernel.h)
    
    Thus on Fedora 17, with both fallocate(2) in libc and fallocate
    support in fuse, the fallocate invocation is dispatched to glusterfs,
    but the dispatch table (fuse_std_ops in
    xlators/mount/fuse/src/fuse-bridge.c) is too short for one thing;
    the fallocate opcode (43) indexes beyond the end of the table, and
    even when that doesn't directly cause a SEGV, the NULL pointer at
    that location does cause a SEGV when attempting to call the function
    through the pointer.

    In Linux, certain "filesystem-specific" options (passed in string form in last
    argument to mount(2)), such as "rootcontext" or "context" are in fact common to
    all filesystems, including fuse. We should pass them down to the actual
    mount(2) call untouched.
    
    This is achieved by adding "fuse-mountopts" option to mount/fuse translator and
    adjusting the mount helper to propagate it with unrecognized options as they
    are encountered.

    The current dht_fix_layout_of_directory() code, in an attempt to
    maximize overlap of new layout with existing layout (to minimize
    movement of data) fails to do a good job of randomizing new assignment
    even when it could do a better job. In an example where we expand
    from 2 nodes to 4 nodes, the current possibilities are limited in the
    following way -
    
    (theoretical hash range: 00 - 99)
    
    OLD 1
    -----
    server1: 00 - 49
    server2: 50 - 99
    
    NEW 1
    -----
    server1: 00 - 24
    server2: 50 - 74
    server3: 25 - 49
    server4: 75 - 99
    
    OLD 2
    -----
    server1: 50 - 99
    server2: 00 - 49
    
    NEW 2
    ------
    server1: 50 - 74
    server2: 00 - 24
    server3: 25 - 49
    server4: 75 - 99
    
    The above shows that when add-brick from 2 bricks to 4 bricks, server3
    and server4 always get the _same_ hash range no matter what the original
    hash range assignment was.
    
    The fix in this patch is first do the standard new directory assignment
    to a directory (with rotation etc.) and then do the reassignment to
    maximize overlap. This way newly added servers still get random ranges
    and existing servers have a probability of getting either of the quarters
    which were part of its half previously. The same principles hold for
    all add-brick from M to M+N.

    mount/fuse: add mount-option "enable-ino32" for the native client
    
    By default the GlusterFS-native client uses 64-bit inodes. Some 32-bit
    applications can not handle these correctly. Introduce a client-side
    mount option "enable-ino32" which causes the FUSE-client to squash the
    64-bit inodes into a 32-bit value.

    storage/posix: Make posix_fremovexattr anon fd friendly.
    
    Problem:
    For anonymous fds posix_fremovexattr fails to work because the open
    never happens and the fd-ctx is not set with the fd-number.
    
    Fix:
    Use posix_fd_ctx_get which opens and sets the fd-number in the fd-ctx
    for anonymous fds.
    
    Tests:
    Added a syncop call in glustershd to test this change and it worked fine.

    storage/posix: Add or_array/and_array op for xattrop
    
    Problem:
    For set/reset of outcast (ALL changelog bits set per transaction
    type i.e. data/mdata/entry) from afr the capability of OR/AND in
    xattrop is needed in posix.  Otherwise marking outcast will only
    be possible in self-heals where appropriate locks are held so
    that no other transaction is in progress, so exact number can be
    computed with which when XATTROP_ADD happens all bits will be set
    for that changelog.
    
    Fix:
    Implemented new xattrop-op OR_ARRAY, AND_ARRAY. Made checks in
    __add_array to work well with __or_array.
    
    Tests:
    From Afr code made an OR_ARRAY with ALL bits set and it reflected
    on the changelog xattrs. changelog incrementing did not have any
    effects on the all-set changelog.
    
    From Afr code made an AND_ARRAY with 0 and it reflected in the
    changelog xattrs.

    glusterd: Removed pattern match lookup logic on volume options
    
    In light of the comments received on the following patch,
    http://review.gluster.com/#change,3860
    this change knocks off the pattern match lookup logic that once
    enabled wildcard entries to be used for volume options.
    
    Here's a bit on the history of the macro "pattern_match_options",
    coming straight from the author's(Csaba) mouth:
    
    "So, the history of pattern_match_options is as follows:
    
    i. In the volume option table we used to be able to have wildcard
    entries like auth.addr.*.allow and there was a special lookup logic
    to support that, cf.
    http://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/commit/v3.1.0qa40~19
    
    ii. However, later on we stopped using this mechanism:
    http://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/commit/v3.1.0qa40~9
    
    iii. Later on we added the code that allowed the usage of option
    names both in fully qualified (<domain>.<specifier>) and short
    (<specifier>)forms:
    http://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/commit/v3.1.0qa41~10.
    
    At this point, maintaining support for wildcard table entries became
    more difficult (~ error prone), so that part was placed under the macro
    pattern_match_options and -- given that we made no use of the feature
    -- a simple direct lookup logic was introduced. I chose to keep the
    pattern matching logic in the code because I was not really sure about
    the future of it and thought we might want wildcarded table entries
    later. ..."

    cluster/afr: Don't stop entry/data self-heal on metadata split-brain
    
    Problem:
    Entry/Data self-heal is orthogonal to meta-data self-heal.
    meta-data split-brain should not affect entry/data self-heal.
    
    Fix:
    Prevented aborting rest of the self-heals when metadata split-brain
    happens.
    
    Tests:
    1) Simulated meta-data split-brain then checked data-self-heal
    succeed on regular file, entry-self-heal succeed on dir.
    2) Reset meta-data change-log on one of the subvols and checked
    that meta-data self-heal also completes.
    3) Executed self-heal sanity script.

    glusterfsd: rpcsvc actors must return success after an attempt to submit reply
    
    rpcsvc attempts to send "error reply" using the req object. If actor has
    already performed rpcsvc_submit_generic, then req is destroyed. So if the
    actor returned -1 (RPCSVC_ACTOR_ERROR) on failing to submit reply, then req
    would be 'free'd' twice and will result in a crash eventually.

    syncop: Added scaling down logic
    
    RCA:
    Whenever the self-heald tests are done with more than 16 replicates
    The number of sync procs goes to > 2. These threads never die.
    
    Fix:
    Added scaling down logic in syncops so that the threads terminate
    themselves whenever the extra thread is idle for ~10 minutes.
    Minimum number of threads is still 2.
    
    Tests:
    Added logs for launching and terminating procs, made timeout to
    6 seconds and ran volume-heal in a while loop. After logs say
    max number of procs are launched, attached process to gdb and
    verified that the number of syncop threads are 16. Stopped
    volume-heal and observed the logs for terminating the procs.
    Attached gdb to process again to check that the syncop threads
    are just 2. Did this 5 times. Things worked fine. Which procs
    were terminated was random. No proc structure was erroneously
    re-used. Procs never exceeded 16 and were never < 2.

    fuse: have setxattr on geo-rep related xattrs take effect
    
    In http://review.gluster.com/3687 setxattr was made to a noop for
    geo-rep special clients, with the exception of some special ones,
    relevant to geo-rep. These exceptions were all in trusted namespace.
    
    That's no good, because with a mountbroker (unprivileged) setup,
    the relevant attributes are in system namespace. So here we
    just let setxattr through for any geo-rep related xattr, regardless
    of namespace.

    misleading/wrong keep-alive error message in log
    
    Gluster NFS and brick logs contain the following log entries:
    
    [2012-08-16 09:23:39.498998] W [socket.c:410:__socket_keepalive] 0-socket: failed to set keep idle on socket 8

    [2012-08-16 09:23:42.673756] I [client-handshake.c:1636:select_server_supported_
    
    Stepping through the code though, setting keep-alive did actually work,
    it's the keep-idle that failed.
    
    The actual problem is setting keep-idle on non-AF_INET sockets results
    in the spurious error message in the log.

    NetBSD swapcontext() portability fix
    
    Further analysis of the problem reveals some wrong conclusions I made
    before. NetBSD's swapcontext() preempts no thread. It alters the
    pthread private pointer, leading to multiple threads with the same
    pthread pointer. That led me to the wrong conclusion that thread were
    preempted. I guess this can be called a bug: NetBSD swapcontext()
    is incompatible with libpthread.
    
    Fortunately, there is a workaround, swapcontext() can be told to
    let the pthread private pointer untouched. This change just does
    that, fixing the crashes without sacrifying performances.
    
    There is just one problem: not all NetBSD ports have the capability
    to do that: at least ports using sh3, sparc, sparc64 and powerpc
    are left broken by this change. This problem will be addressed by
    upcoming fixes in NetBSD.

    In glusterd_urltransform, a failed GF_REALLOC would clobber
    the would-be-realloc'd buffer, linearr, with a NULL pointer,
    (thus leaking that memory) and then control would pass to the

    mount/fuse: ignore any erros that might've happened while resolving entry in resolver.
    
    One error we hit was absence of gfid on backend. While the lookup
    code-path generates a new uuid and sets it on file, resolver code
    doesn't do that. Since, functionally (atleast after resolving parent
    inode, we would be resolving the path in new-graph) both resolver
    and lookup does same work, it would be no harm in ignoring errors
    during resolving the entry. This would help us to continue with
    the _extra_ work (like healing gfid as of now) in fuse_lookup_resume.

    glusterd: Fix glusterd crash resulting from uninitialised pointer
    
    PROBLEM:
    glusterd crashes during replace-brick operation as the
    pointer old_brickinfo is dereferenced without being initialised.
    
    FIX:
    Have old_brickinfo initialised to point to the brick info of
    the brick being replaced before dereferencing it.
    
    TEST:
    Ran glusterd in debug mode before and after the fix;
    process crash ceased in the latter case.

    cluster/afr: Unwind with correct pre/post parent bufs
    
    RCA:
    In case of dir fops create, mknod, mkdir, link, symlink, rename
    if the fop fails on read-child then unwinds are happening with
    all-zero pre/post iatt-bufs. The bug occurs because the parent
    bufs are not saved if the response is not from read-child.
    
    Fix:
    Save the pre/post-bufs for the first response. If the response
    comes from read-child, overwrite whatever we have cached.
    
    Tests:
    Attached the mount process to gdb.
    Tested that the unwinds happen with proper pre/post iatt bufs in
    the following cases:
    1) All success case
    2) Failure on read-child
    3) Failure on non-read-child
    4) Failure on all children.
    
    Tested soft-link self-heal to test the change made in that.
    Tested errno ENOTEMPTY for rmdir, rename fops.

    cluster/afr: Handle child_up & fd not opened case in xaction
    
    RCA:
    When an fd is opened while a brick is down, after the brick
    comes back up afr issues open on the other brick. It can
    fail for a number of reasons (enoent etc). While the system
    is in that state, inode/entrylks pre-op happen only on the
    brick that is up and fd is opened for fd-fops. post-op should
    consider only the bricks where both pre-op and fop succeeded
    as success, rest of them as failures. Code now marks only the
    children that are down as failures as opposed to child_down &
    fd-not-opened. This makes change-log appear as success on the
    subvolume where we did not do any fop leading to no change-log
    but differences in data/metadata for reg-files.
    
    Fix:
    Mark non-participants of fop as failure. This is tracked in
    transaction.pre_op[].
    
    Tests:
    Simulated the scenario using err-gen on top of one of the client
    xlator which fails all fops always. Performed fops and the changelog
    represented pending fops on the brick with err-gen loaded. Tested
    the case of brick down and perform entry/metadata/data operations
    to confirm they still work as expected.

    supportability: print all missing frames
    
    earlier, the statedump and backtrace were printing frames only if
    it matched type GF_FOPs or GF_MGMTs (GF_MGMT is not in use now).
    This made all the frames from glusterd, or any other frames which
    got created outside the scope of 'fops' not getting printed.
    
    now, made two classifications, one as FOPs (which gets logged
    with the proper name), and another set is !FOPs (ie, else part),
    which gets logged with only the op number.

    protocol/client: Fix negative return in client_setvolume
    
    PROBLEM:
    The function dict_serialized_length could, owing to an error,
    return a negative integer (-EINVAL) that gets assigned to an
    unsigned int member 'dict_len' of gf_setvolume_req structure.
    
    FIX:
    Hold the value returned by dict_serialized_length in local
    variable ret (which is a signed int). Test if ret is negative,
    in which case the control would anyway branch to the label fail
    where the function returns. Otherwise dict_len is assigned with
    ret, in turn giving a more meaningful value to the attribute
    length.
    
    TEST:
    Attached gdb to glusterfs mount process, set breakpoint at
    client_setvolume, forced dict_serialized_length to return
    -EINVAL (indirectly by forcing _dict_serialized_length to return
    -EINVAL after setting count to -1 within its body) and checked
    the value of ret (which is now sure to contain a negative value)
    whose value will be appropriately tested to decide the next
    course of action within client_setvolume: whether to simply
    exit due to an error or execute the subsequent statements.

    variables as NULL to test the change. Removed the code to verify

    cluster/stripe: handle short writes and errors in writev callback
    
    cluster/stripe write callback handling is broken in the event of
    server side errors and short writes due to crudely summing up the
    return values from each node. This can produce incorrect results
    or cause an application to rewrite the wrong portions of a buffer
    in an attempt to handle this condition.
    
    Modify cluster/stripe writev handling to record the requested size
    of each write and use this data to return the number of consecutive
    bytes written from the original request. This allows an application
    to retry a write at the point of error (and potentially consume
    said error).

    performance/io-threads: Provide option to turn off least-priority
    
    RCA:
    In cases when self-heal is in progress, self-heal fops are starved
    because of least-priority. This affects other fops with conflicting
    inode, entry locks with self-heal.
    
    Fix:
    This patch provides configuring enable/disable of least-priority.
    
    Additional changes:
    Moved RCHECKSUM fop to low instead of least because it will still
    affect the performance of other fops if RCHECKSUM is in LEAST
    priority.
    
    Tests:
    Tested that the enabling/disabling of fops is working fine.
    Tested that RCHECKSUM fop priority is assigned LOW when
    least-priority is disabled.

    cli: Prevent creation of volumes with tokens as volnames
    
    RCA:
    yyparse confuses volnames with tokens when any of the
    tokens 'volume', 'type', 'subvolumes', 'option', 'end-volume'
    are used as volnames. This happens because io-stats xlator
    name is same as volname in fuse volfile. Both nfs, fuse volfiles
    are affected by this problem.
    
    Fix:
    We could fix this also by changing io-stats xlator name to
    something other than 'volname'. But I am worried of the
    backward compatibility issues it may introduce. Disallowing
    creation of volumes with tokens as volname seems like a safer
    fix.
    
    Tests:
    All volume creation operations with tokens as volname give
    invalid volume name error.

    cluster/afr: Modified split-brain handling
    
    RCA
    The bug is observed because the decision to mark
    a file in split-brain is taken outside appropriate locks.
    Lookup gathers xattrs outside any lock. The xattrs being
    in split-brain in lookup should only be taken as a hint.
    Appropriate inodelks should be taken before confirming
    a split-brain. Self-heal confirms this at the moment.
    If data/metadata self-heal is turned off, inspecting of
    xattrs could not be performed so split-brain behavior
    does not work correctly if the self-heal options are turned off.
    
    Fix
    Self-heals are launched to inspect xattrs even when the
    data/metadata self-heal options are turned off. The decision
    to heal data/metadata after the xattrs are inspected is based
    on whether the options are turned on/off. So decision to set/reset
    split-brain flag is taken inside appropriate locks.
    
    Testcases:
    tests 33-36 in
    https://github.com/pranithk/gluster-tests/blob/master/afr/self-heal.sh

    cluster/afr: Filter O_TRUNC in afr-fix-open
    
    RCA:
    When open was done while a brick is down, afr opens the file after
    the brick comes backup. If this happens after the self-heal on the file
    is completed by self-heald etc, the file will end up in truncated state.
    
    Fix:
    Filter O_TRUNC while afr-fix-open because afr_open turns O_TRUNC
    into truncate transaction, so there will be pending changelog for
    the subvolume on which open fails.
    
    Testing:
    Had to simulate the race by stopping fix-open until self-heald completes
    self-heal on the file after brick online.

    cluster: fix crash on link of named pipe in stripe/replicate vol
    
    A crash occurs when attempting to link a named pipe on a striped,
    replicated volume. The cause for this crash is attempting to deref
    a NULL inode pointer in stripe_link_cbk(). The RCA for this bug
    uncovered a couple of problems:
    
    - AFR ignores the inode pointer it receives on failure (returning
      NULL).
    - stripe assumes the inode pointer is valid on failure.
    
    Either one of these changes addresses the crash, but this patch
    includes both changes. AFR is modified to pass along the inode
    pointer it receives (which could still be NULL). stripe is
    modified to not assume the inode pointer is valid on fop failure.

    libglusterfs: fix creation of spurious root inodes
    
    Suppose lookup is sent on a newly created inode (gfid is root gfid),
    and in the call back inode_link is done, where if there is an inode
    already present in the inode table for that gfid, then we start using
    the present inode and the newly created inode supposedly gets destroyed
    when refcount comes down to zero through inode_unref calls.
    
    But inodes with root gfid are not unrefed. Now since in inode_link,
    the gfid has already been copied to the new inode and later the actual
    inode is found from the inode table, the new inode does not gets unrefed
    if its gfid is root gfid. Thus those spurious inodes with root gfid will
    be present throughout the lifetime of the filesystem.
    
    To fix this first search the inode table for an inode, with the gfid, present
    in the stat structure received as an argument. If the inode is not found,
    then copy the gfid to the newly created inode. Now whenever unref is called on
    on the new inode it gets unrefed and thus eventually gets destroyed

    Fixes for gsyncd / geo-rep and FUSE listxattr
    
    This patch fixes two problems with recent changes to
    Geo-Replication
    
    First:
    ------
    Recent changes to geo-replication relies on Rsync to tranfer
    extended attributes. Essentially Rsync would invoke a listxattr()
    and then getxattr() the set reutrned by listxattr() and finally
    transfer it to the remote slave. Xattrs like security.selinux would
    create problems as they are not allowed to be set explicitly (unless
    there's a rule that allows this). So, to make Rsync behave sanely we
    filter out all "*.selinux*" xattrs from listxattr() (which is getxattr()
    with ->name as NULL).
    
    Second:
    -------
    Python's "if {..} else {..}" shortcut ".. and .. or .." was misused here.
    This is a straightforward fix by interchanging last two variables (classes
    in this case). Also fix a typo in sendmark_regular() definition.

    FUSE: ignore setxattr for some keys from gsyncd aux mount
    
    Context
    -------
    gsyncd/geo-rep plans to rely on Rsync to sync extended attributes.
    When this is in place, all xattrs *visible* on the mount point would
    be candidate for syncing. This set could include gluster internal
    xattrs too (as xome xlators do not filter out in their cbks). Syncing
    these xattrs to the slave could result in unexpected functioning of
    the slave mount.
    
    Soln.
    -----
    For gsyncd auxillary mounts (identified by client_pid -1), we only
    allow xtime related xattrs to go through and silently ignore (w/o
    propagating error back to the client) the rest of them. This provides
    a future proof solution as we need not worry about what xattrs show
    up on the mounts. Also, 'user' namespace xattrs are always passed
    through even if it's from a gsyncd aux mount.

    glfsxmp: libgfapi based example
    
    This is an example application which uses libgfapi. It is
    a complete autotools based build system which demonstrates the
    required changes in configure.ac, Makefile.am etc to successfuly
    detect for and build an application against libgfapi.
    
    There are two approaches to building a libgfapi based application:
    
    1. In the presence of pkg-config in your build system.
    This is the recommended approach which is also used in this example.
    For this approach to work, you need to build glusterfs by passing
    --pkgconfigdir=/usr/lib64/pkgconfig (or the appropriate directory)
    in your distro. This already happens if you build RPMs with the
    glusterfs.spec provided in glusterfs.git. You will also need to
    install glusterfs-api RPM.
    
    2. In the absence of pkg-config in your build system.
    Make sure your LDFLAGS includes -L/path/to/lib where libgfapi.so is
    installed and -I/path/to/include/glusterfs where the 'api' directory

    glusterfs_ctx_t: un-globalize the filesystem context
    
    So far there has been a global glusterfs_ctx_t object which
    represents the running instance of the filesystem (client or server).
    It contains the various graphs, connection to the management daemon
    over which new graphs are obtained, calls stacks issued on this
    filesystem, and a bunch of such things.
    
    With the introduction of libgfapi, it is no more true that there will
    be only one filesystem context in a process. Applications can
    be written to use libgfapi and obtain serveral instances of different
    filesystems/volumes in the same process.
    
    This involves messy untangling of assumptions inside libglusterfs that
    there would only be one global glusterfs_ctx_t and offload that
    assumption to glusterfsd/ and cli/ (where it is true).

    libglusterfs,mount/fuse: implement gidcache mechanism in fuse-bridge
    
    This change genericizes the cache mechanism implemented in commit
    8efd2845 into libglusterfs/src/gidcache.[ch] and adds fuse-bridge as
    a client. The cache mechanism is fundamentally equivalent, with some
    minor changes:
    
      - Change cache key from uid_t to uint64_t.
      - Modify the cache add logic to locate and use an entry with a
        matching ID, should it already exist. This addresses a bug in
        the existing mechanism where an expired entry supercedes a newly
        added entry in lookup, causing repeated adds and flushing of a
        cache bucket.
    
    The fuse group cache is disabled by default. It can be enabled via
    the 'gid-timeout' fuse-bridge translator option and accompanying
    mount option (i.e., '-o gid-timeout=1' for a 1s entry timeout).

    fuse/md-cache: add support for the 'fopen-keep-cache' mount option
    
    fopen-keep-cache disables unconditional page-cache invalidations
    on file open in fuse (via FOPEN_KEEP_CACHE) and replaces that
    behavior with detection of remote changes and explicit
    invalidations from mount/fuse. This option improves local caching
    through the page cache and native client.
    
    This change defines a new 'invalidate' translator callback to
    identify when an inode's cache mapping has been determined to be
    invalid. md-cache implements the policy to detect and invoke
    inode invalidations. fuse-bridge and io-cache implement
    invalidate handlers to invalidate the respective caches (page
    cache in the case of fuse).

    calls to dict_allocate_and_serialize() are not 64-bit clean
    
    All calls to dict_allocate_and_serialize() pass the address of a 32-bit
    type, but must cast it to the 64-bit pointer type (size_t *).
    
    This happens to work on LE machines, but even if it's apparently benign,
    it's still a bug. On BE machines it is not benign.
    
    GF_PROTOCOL_DICT_SERIALIZE() hacks around it by creating a size_t temp
    var, but that's, well, a hack, IMO when you consider that all the callers
    are actually passing &<u_int>; the param should just be a u_int * and
    eliminate the buggy casts and the temp var in the macro.
    
    Nobody apparently uses the Fedora/EPEL PPC RPMs, but they might. People
    are trying to build gluster.org bits on SPARC and tripping over this.

    glusterd_gsync_read_frm_status reads what is expected to be a NUL-
    terminated status string from the specified file, but makes two
    mistakes when trying to do the favor of trimming trailing spaces.
    Do not let a leading NUL byte of status cause us to read buf[-1]
    and possibly to clear that and any preceding "trailing" spaces.
    Do not let a blen-byte input (with no NUL byte) cause our use of
    strlen to access beyond the end of non-NUL-terminated buffer.
    
    I looked at this code because coverity reported that it was
    assuming a read-provided buffer to be NUL-terminated.

    core: check for pre-allocated blocks in backend fs, fix it.
    
    There is a possibility that the backend FS (like XFS) can
    allocate blocks beyond EOF for better performance reasons, which
    results in 'st_blocks' with higher values than what is consumed by
    the file descriptor. This would break few logic inside GlusterFS,
    like quota behavior etc, thus we need the exact number of blocks
    which are consumed by the file to the higher layers inside GlusterFS.
    
    Currently, this logic won't work for sparse files (ie, file with holes)

    glusterfsd: don't ignore tmpfile write failure (2x)
    
    In both glusterfs_volfile_reconfigure and mgmt_getspec_cbk,
    we fwrite to a temporary file, fflush the stream, and then
    rewind and read from it.  However, if either the fwrite or
    fflush were to fail, we would have ignored a write failure
    and would then read and process corrupt or incomplete input.
    In each case, add a test of ferror so that we don't ignore
    the write failure.

    volinfo->volname would end up not being NUL-terminated.

    cluster/afr: cleanup lk_owner and PID mess
    
    Historically PID (frame->root->pid) was used by the locks translator
    to identify a locker (and make decisions about which locks contend
    or cooperate/merge). Since the introduction of lock_owner parameter
    the usage of PID (for locks) was deprecated and is now unused. This
    patch nukes the usage of PID in AFR
    
    The usage of lk_owner has also ended up being a mess, because of the
    differentiation required between ->lk() and ->inodelk(), (->lk() needs
    to be identified by the process (roughly) and ->inodelk() needs to be
    identified by the transaction) and also because of optimizations like
    eager locking (locks are no more identified by the transaction as they
    now get inherited by the next transaction).
    
    The scheme (and technique) now is:
    
    - All FOPs (the third phase of the transaction) happen with the lk_owner
      which is set by the topmost layer (FUSE, NFS etc.)
    
    - All entrylks are issued with lk_owner set to the frame->root address.
    
    - Inodelks which will not be subject to eager locking are issued with
      lk_owner set to frame->root.
    
    - Inodelks which are subject to eager locking are issued with lk_owner
      set to the address of fd_t (which are the only type of frames which
      get subject to the eager locking optimization)
    
    - At the start of the transaction, the transaction frame's lk_owner is
      set to the either frame->root or fd_t (and never unmodified) depending
      on the type of transaction.
    
    - Just before the third phase (FOP phase) the set lk_owner is "saved"
      away and overwritten by the lk_owner submitted by the top layer (FUSE
      or NFS)
    
    - Right after the third phase, the saved lk_owner is "restored" to resume
      the transaction into the POST-OP and eventually UNLOCK using the same
      lk_owner which was used during the LOCK phase.

    cluster/afr: add a new option to select read-subvol by index
    
    read subvolume is a nice option to set prefred read child if you have a
    replication over 2 datacenter.  if you have 2 datacenter and have a
    distributed replication where one set of servers are in datacenter one
    and the other (the replicated) are in the other datacenter
    read-subvolume it not very handy since it goes over name and the
    subvolume name is different for each replication pair.  i added a new
    option called read-subvolume-index which take the number of the
    subvolume to choose.  0 fo first , 1 for second and so on subvolume in
    every replication.  this option can now be used in the --xlator-option
    mount option to choose the prefered read child for all replication at
    once.  For Example on all clients in datacenter one you can use
    --xlator-option=volumename-replication-*.read-subvolume-index=0 to
    prefer read from the servers in datacenter one.  when you expand or
    shrink the volume no changes are needed to the client config since the
    wildcard will set this option automatic on reconfigure.

    bdb: fix erroneous strncpy in file name construction
    
    Using strncpy like that fails to copy the trailing NUL byte of

    entry_path is stat'ed in the code just below.  Besides, there is
    no need for strncpy, since we know the source buffer will fit
    in the possibly-just-realloc'd destination buffer: use memcpy
    and +1 to include the trailing NUL.

    glusterd, cli: handle uuid conflicts in probe gracefully
    
    A commonly faced problem among glusterfs users is: after a fresh
    installation of glusterfs in a virtual machine, the VM image is
    cloned to make multiple instances of the server. This breaks
    glusterd because right after glusterfs installation on the first
    boot glusterd would have created the node UUID and this gets
    inherited into the clone. The result is wierd behavior at the time
    of peer probe where glusterd does not (yet) deal with UUID
    collisions in a user friendly way.
    
    With this patch the peer which got the probe request will compare
    the uuid of the machine which send the probe request with its own
    uuid and send the proper error to cli if the uuids are same.

    rpc: Fixed ping timer algo.
    
    The purpose of the ping timer is to assert the absence of any evidence
    the server is possibly alive.
    
    The current implementation updates the 'last_sent' timer in the following
    points in time,
    - rpc_clnt_submit: when rpc messages are being queued at the transport
      layer. (wrong!, since we have no way to determine if server actually
      received the message)
    - rpc_clnt_notify: when client receives pollout event on sending a message
      on the 'wire'. (correct, since it indicates ACK from server)
    
    The fix removes the 'incorrect' update of 'last_sent'.

    localtime and ctime are not MT-SAFE
    
    There are a number of nit-level issues throughout the source with
    the use of localtime and ctime. While they apparently aren't causing
    too many problems, apart from the one in bz 828058, they ought to be
    fixed.  Among the "real" problems that are fixed in this patch:
     1) general localtime and ctime not MT-SAFE. There's a non-zero chance
        that another thread calling localtime (or ctime) will over-write
        the static data about to be used in another thread
     2) localtime(& <64-bit-type>) or ctime(& <64-bit-type>) generally
        not a problem on 64-bit or little-endian 32-bit. But even though
        we probably have zero users on big-ending 32-bit platforms, it's
        still incorrect.
     3) multiple nested calls passed as params. Last one wins, i.e. over-
        writes result of prior calls.
     4) Inconsistent error handling. Most of these calls are for logging,
        tracing, or dumping. I submit that if an error somehow occurs in
        the call to localtime or ctime, the log/trace/dump still should
        still occur.
     5) Appliances should all have their clocks set to UTC, and all log
        entries, traces, and dumps should use GMT.
     6) fix strtok(), change to strtok_r()
    
    Other things this patch fixes/changes (that aren't bugs per se):
     1) Change "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" and similar to their equivalent shorthand,
        e.g. "%F %T"
     2) change sizeof(timestr) to sizeof timestr. sizeof is an operator,
        not a function. You don't use i +(32), why use sizeof(<var>).
        (And yes, you do use parens with sizeof(<type>).)
     3) change 'char timestr[256]' to 'char timestr[32]' where appropriate.
        Per-thread stack is limited. Time strings are never longer than ~20
        characters, so why waste 220+ bytes on the stack?
    
    Things this patch doesn't fix:
     1) hodgepodge of %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S versus %Y/%m/%d-%H%M%S and other
        variations. It's not clear to me whether this ever matters, not to
        mention 3rd party log filtering tools may already rely on a
        particular format. Still it would be nice to have a single manifest
        constant and have every call to localtime/strftime consistently use
        the same format.

    protocol/client: Re-open should not have O_CREAT|O_TRUNC|O_EXCL
    
    RCA
    The bug is observed in 3.2.x because posix xlator changes
    the uid/gid of file as per frame->root-uid/gid if O_CREAT flag
    is set in open fop. Posix does not do this in 3.3.x so that
    bug does not appear anymore but this issue exposed the actual
    bug in client xlator re-open. Re-open of a file on re-connection
    should not perform re-open with the same flags at the time of
    open/create/opendir. Imagine a case where a file is opened with
    O_TRUNC|O_RDWR and some data is written to it, now if the brick
    goes down and comes back the file will be truncated.
    When I tested this case, the file is not truncated because locks
    xlator resets O_TRUNC unconditionally.
    Client xlator re-open bug and locks xlator bug cancel each other.
    
    Fix
    Reset O_CREAT|O_TRUNC|O_EXCL flags in re-open.
    Locks xlator should not reset O_TRUNC.
    
    Additional changes
    Removed wbflags as it is not assigned at all.

    gsyncd / geo-rep : failover/failback
    
    This commit is based on Venky Shankar <vshankar@>'s
    original implementation. Let us first quote Venky's
    description, then we summarize changes to his work.
    
    ------
    First version of failover/failback.
    
    Failback mechanism uses two exclusive modes:
      * blind-sync
        This mode works with xtime pairs (both master and slave) to
        identify candidated to sync the original master from the slave
    
      * wrapup-sync
        This mode is similar to the normal working of gsyncd except
        that orphaned entities in the gluster volume are not assigned
        xtimes. This prevents un-necessary transfer of data for such
        entities.
    
    Modes can be enabled via:
    
      gluster volume geo-replication M S config special_sync_mode blind
      gluster volume geo-replication M S config special_sync_mode wrapup
    
    To turn off the special modes (i.e. to revert to normal gsyncd behaviour) use:
    
      gluster volume geo-replication colon-d0 192.168.1.2::colon-d config \!special_sync_mode
    ------
    
    Code has been refactored to meet following goals:
    
    - make checkpointing work with special sync modes
    - move out sync mode related conditionals from the crawl
      loop and make all decisions to be made at startup
      time
    - be intrusive to the crawl loop to smallest possible degree
      (we will have to change/revisit it for other reasons,
      and the complexity of that should not increase)
    
    So, xtime parsing/updating/evaluation that's specific to
    the certain special modes are represented as mixin classes;
    basic operation logic is in an abstract base class.
    On startup, special-sync-mode tunable is dynamically dispatched
    to the corresponding mixin and the actual master class is
    derived from the chosen mixin and the ABS.

    geo-rep: checkpointing
    
    - gluster vol geo-rep M S conf checkpoint <LABEL|now>
    
      sets a checkpoint with LABEL (the keyword "now" is special,
      it's rendered to the label "as of <timestamp of current time>")
      that's used to refer to the checkpoint in the sequel.
    
      (Technically, gsyncd makes a note of the xtime of master's root
      as of setting the checkpoint, called the "checkpoint target".)
    
    - gluster vol geo-rep M S conf \!checkpoint
    
      deletes the checkpoint.
    
    - gluster vol geo-rep M S stat
    
      if status is OK, and there is a checkpoint configured, the checkpoint
      info is appended to status (either "not yet reached", or
      "completed at <timestamp of completion>").
    
      (Technically, the worker runs a thread that monitors / serializes /
      verifies checkpoint status, and answers checkpoint status requests
      through a UNIX socket; monitoring boils down to querying the xtime
      of slave's root and comparing with the target.)
    
    - gluster vol geo-rep M S conf log-file | xargs grep checkpoint
    
      displays the checkpoint history. Set, delete and completion events
      are logged properly.

    cluster/stripe: implement the coalesce stripe file format
    
    The coalesce file format for cluster/stripe condenses the striped
    files to a contiguous layout. The elimination of holes in striped
    files eliminates space wasted via local filesystem preallocation
    heuristics and significantly improves read performance.
    
    Coalesce mode is implemented with a new 'coalesce' xlator option,
    which is user-configurable and disabled by default. The format of
    newly created files is marked with a new 'stripe-coalesce' xattr.
    Cluster/stripe handles/preserves the format of files regardless
    of the current mode of operation (i.e., a volume can
    simultaneously consist of coalesced and non-coalesced files).
    Files without the stripe-coalesce attribute are assumed to have
    the traditional format to provide backward compatibility.
    
    extras/stripe-merge: support traditional and coalesce stripe formats
    
    Update the stripe-merge recovery tool to handle the traditional
    and coalesced file formats. The format of the file is detected
    automatically (and verified) via the stripe-coalesce attributes.

    glusterd: generate node UUID lazily
    
    A commonly faced problem among glusterfs users is: after a fresh
    installation of glusterfs in a virtual machine, the VM image is
    cloned to make multiple instances of the server. This breaks
    glusterd because right after glusterfs installation on the first
    boot glusterd would have created the node UUID and this gets
    inherited into the clone. The result is wierd behavior at the time
    of peer probe where glusterd does not (yet) deal with UUID
    collisions in a user friendly way.
    
    This patch is for the 'prevention' of the issue. The approach here
    is to avoid generating a UUID on the first start of glusterd, but
    instead generate a node UUID only when a node UUID is found to be
    necessary. This naturally avoids the creation of node UUID on first
    boot and prevents the issue to a large extent.
    
    This issue also needs a 'cure' patch, which gives more meaningful
    error messages to the user and provides CLI to recover from the
    situations (gluster peer reset?)

    libglusterfs : Fix validation for integer volume options.
    
    Integer volume options which specified only the min value as 0, would not be
    validated during "volume set".
    The range check for an option happened only if  both min and max were not 0. In
    the above case, even though a minium was specified, the range check did not
    happen as both min and max were 0.
    
    To allow forced validation in such cases, a new member, "validate", has been
    added to volume_options_t. This member takes the values GF_OPT_VALIDATE_BOTH,
    GF_OPT_VALIDATE_MIN and GF_OPT_VALIDATE_MAX (GF_OPT_VALIDATE_BOTH is the
    default).

    gfid_req is set only by the fuse xlator. Fresh lookups
    performed by self-heal-daemon, rebalance will not have

    protocol/client: Remember the gfid of opened fd
    
    This is needed when the fresh lookup triggers self-heal, gfid
    won't be present in inode yet. Similar situation happens with
    Rebalance as it does not perform inode_link.
    Added similar fix for re-opendir.
    Removed inode from fdctx and removed some duplication of code.

    rpc-transport/socket: fix the state machine for XDATA reading
    
    The socket state machine was broken for reading XDATA on the server.
    This code was structured such that when there was a partial read in
    a particular state, some variables would remain uninitialized in the
    next 'run' of the state machine. Also did some re-org of the state
    machine with two more states to make the code more readable and similar
    in state-breakup pattern to the other states.

    cli: let commands specify the exit value in batch mode
    
    Old behavior: when cli is ran in batch mode (sequence of commands are
    fed to it in stdin), if a command returns an error (ie. -1), the cli
    exits upon it with 255 (-1 on 8 bit).
    
    New behavior: consider any non-zero return from cli commands as error
    and use the negative of that return value as exit value, thus giving
    control to cli commands over the exit value, while (as of the existing
    command set) adhering to the convention of exiting with 1 on error.
    
    Spotted upon stumbling upon mount/umount commands which did want
    to exit with 1 on error but that was not possible as of old behavior.

    core: xlator option framework cleanups
    
    - Upon init/reconf, if an option is not in the opt dict,
      and a default value is neither specified, null it out.
      With this, the xlator config data that comes
      out of init/reconf becomes deterministic in terms
      of the xlator option declarations and the incoming
      option value dictionary. (Needed for correct operation
      of volume reset.)
    
    - We can rely bravely on the guarantee given by init/reconf
      as of which no NULL value is passed to the converter
      functions. Drop the spurious null check of not_null(),
      and rebaptize it to pass().

    Optimize for small dicts, and avoid an overrun.
    
    As dicts get used more and more in the I/O path (especially for xattrs and
    the new xdata feature), removing some of their inherent inefficiency
    becomes more important.  This patch addresses some of the issues around
    allocating data_pair_t structures separately.  Along the way, I found that
    the way we're allocating the "members" hash table was subtly wrong, and
    could lead to a memory overrun.  This is a latent bug because nobody uses
    dict_get_new_full that way, but I added an assert to guard against that
    possibility.  One beneficial side effect is that we now save four pointers'
    worth of space per dict, offsetting the extra space used for the new
    members.

    replicate: add hashed read-child method.
    
    Both the first-to-respond method and the round-robin method are susceptible
    to clients repeatedly choosing the same servers across a series of opens,
    creating hot spots.  Also, the code to handle a replica being down will
    ignore both methods and just choose the first remaining (which is not an
    issue for two-way but can be otherwise).  The hashed method more reliably
    avoids such hot spots.  There are three values/modes.
    
    0: use the old (broken) methods.
    
    1: select a read-child based on a hash of the file's GFID, so all clients
       will choose the same subvolume for a file (ensuring maximum consistency)
       but will distribute load for a set of files.
    
    2: select a read-child based on a hash of the file's GFID plus the client's
       PID, so different children will distribute load even for one file.
    
    Mode 2 will probably be optimal for most cases.  Using response time when we
    open the file is problematic, both because a single sample might not have
    been representative even then and because load might have shifted in the
    hours or days since (for long-lived files).  Trying to use more current load
    information can lead to "herd following" behavior which is just as bad.
    Pseudo-random distribution is likely to be the best we can reasonably do,
    just as it is for DHT.

    storage/posix: Prevent gfid handle leaks
    
    The case which can lead to gfid handle leaks:
    Self-heal removes directory '/d' with 10 files in it, in brick b1.
    This dir is renamed to <landfill>/<hashval of '<brick-path>/d'>
    by posix. Before the janitor thread could remove the directory,
    self-heal could remove another directory with same path '/d'.
    Then again the rename to same path is done by posix as before.
    The gfid-handles of the old '/d', 10 files in it are not unlinked.
    
    To prevent such problems, rename the directory to be removed to
    <landfill>/<gfid-str>.

    The keys in the above mentioned namespace could be used by hook

    the scope of glusterd. It is the responsibility of the storage admin
    to keep the meaning of the key(s) consistent.
    
    If a user gives a command like
    
     'gluster volume set <VOLNAME> user.for-this-key do-this"
    
    scripts would get 'user.for-this-key=do-this' as argument.

    mount the GlusterFS volume on the mount point. This process is racy
    and may mount multiple times on the same mount point.
    
    Also added a new option object_only in fs.conf which should be enabled
    only if the user requires ReST interface and will have better performance.
    By default it is set "off".

    glusterd: Run post hooks on a different thread
    
    This change ensures post hooks can 'wait' if need be
    and _not_ prevent glusterd from being able to run other operations
    meanwhile.
    
    Also ensures that post hook scripts are 'serialized'
    between transactions. ie, post hook scripts of txn1 are completed
    before post hook scripts of txn2 are started, where txn1 happens before
    txn2.

    Switch to GNU basename_r() and dirname_r()
    
    BSD basename() and dirname() return static storage, hence they are not
    thread safe, while GNU flavors are. glusterfs assumes the GNU behavior.
    As a fix, we added a BSD-derived, thread-safe version of basename_r()
    and dirname_r() in contrib/libgen. BSD systems can use it instead of
    their built in versions.
    
    Unfortunately, there are more reliance on GNU behavior in glusterfs.
    There are place where free() is called on static storage returned by
    basename(), place where a second call to dirname() overwrite the
    string obtained once, and so forth.
    
    Each of these problems can be fixed, but it is likely to be a pandora
    box. We need to accept that glusterfs heavily rely on GNU behavior,
    and switch contrib/libgen's basename_r() and dirname_r() to the GNU
    version. This change does just that.

    geo-rep / gsyncd: further cleanup refinements
    
    - Regarding issue of leftover ssh control dirs:
    
      If master side worker is stuck in connection establishment
      phase, have the monitor kill it softly (ie. first by SIGTERM,
      to let it cleanup). This is trickier than sounds on first hearing,
      because if worker is stuck in waiting for a RePCe answer
      (in threading.Condition().wait()), then SIGTERM is ignored
      (more precisely, Python holds it back for the wait and resends it to
      itself when wait is over).
    
      So instead of signalling the worker only, we send TERM to the
      whole process group -- that brings down the ssh connection, which
      wakes up the waiting worker, which then can cleanup. Only problem
      is that monitor is also in the process group and it should not coomit
      a suicide. That is taken care by setting up a one-time SIGTERM
      handler in the monitor.
    
    - Regarding slave gsyncd stuck in chdir:
    
      Slave gsyncd is usually well behaved: if master does not send
      keepalives, it takes care to exit. However, if a hang occurs
      in early phase, when slave is to change to the gluster mountpoint,
      no timeout is set up for that (and unlike on master side, neither
      is there an external actor like the monitor to do that).
    
      So, to manage this scenario, we do the chdir in a (supposedly)
      short lived thread, and in the main thread we wait for the termination
      of this thread. If that does not happen within the time limit, main
      thread calls for cleanup and exit. (This logic explicitely takes the
      appropriate action in the cases when chdir succeeds or when hangs;
      but what about the remaining case, when chdir fails? Well in that case
      the chdir thread's exception handler will put the process to
      cleanup and exit route.)

    performance/quick-read: fix race-conditions in qr_unlink.
    
    The list of fds on which open needs to be done as part of unlink,
    was being modified at different places using different locks.
    This resulted in a race-condition where open was marked as in-transit,
    but fdctx was removed from the list of fds on which open was being
    sent even before open was done. Because of this, open_in_transit would
    be set forever (as an open was never actually sent, there would be no
    open_cbk called and hence we could not reset the variable), blocking
    all the future fd based fops on this fd.

    nlm: do not use killall command to kill rpc.statd
    
    killall command will kill the rpc.statd process only in normal mode.
    If the process is running in valgrind mode, then killall is not able
    to kill rpc.statd and several instances of rpc.statd will be running
    for every restart of the nfs server (graph changes etc).
    
    So to avoid that get the pid of rpc.statd using /var/run/rpc.statd.pid
    and send SIGKILL signal to that pid to accomplish what killall command
    was doing.

    geo-rep / gsyncd: fix cleanup of temporary mounts
    
    [This is a "forward port" of fafd5c17, http://review.gluster.com/2908]
    
    The "finally" clause that was meant to cleanup after the
    temp mount has not covered the case of getting signalled
    (eg. by monitor, upon worker timing out).
    
    So here we "outsource" the cleanup to an ephemeral child process.
    Child calls setsid(2) so it won't be bothered by internal process
    management. We use a pipe in between worker and the cleanup child;
    when child sees the worker end getting closed, it performs the cleanup.
    Worker end can get closed either because worker closes it (normal case),
    or because worker has terminated (faulty case) -- thus as bonus, we get
    a nice uniform handling with no need to differentiate between normal and
    faulty cases.
    
    The faulty case that was seen IRL -- ie., users of maintainance mounts
    hang in chdir(2) to mount point -- can be simulated for testing purposes
    by applying the following patch:
    
      diff --git a/xlators/mount/fuse/src/fuse-bridge.c b/xlators/mount/fuse/src/fuse-bridge.c

    fuse, glusterfsd: mount logic fixes
    
    Commit 7d0397c2 introduced two issues:
    
     i) broke the libfuse derived mount logic (details below)
    ii) in case of a daemonized glusterfs client is ran as daemon, parent
        process can return earlier than the mount is in place, which breaks
        agents that programmatically do a gluster mount via a direct call to
        glusterfs (ie. not via mount(8)).
    
    This patch fixes these issues by a refactor that merges the approaches
    sported by commits
    
      7d0397c2 fuse: allow requests during mount (needed for SELinux labels)
      c5d781e0 upon daemonizing, wait on mtab update to terminate in parent
    
    Original daemonized libfuse event flow is as follows:
    
      try:
        fd = open("/dev/fuse")
        mount("-oopts,fd=%s" % fd ...)
        mount(8) -f    # manipulate mtab
      except:
        sp = socketpair()
        env _FUSE_COMMFD=sp fusermount -oopts
        fd = receive_fd(sp)
    
      where fusermount(1) does:
        fd = open("/dev/fuse")
        mount("-oopts,fd=%d" % fd ...)
        sp = atoi(getenv("_FUSE_COMMFD"))
        send_fd(sp, fd)
    
      daemonize(
        # in child
        fuse_loop(fd)
      )
      # in parent
      exit()
    
    As of 013850c9 (instead of adopting FUSE's 47e61004¹), we went for async
    mtab manipulation, and as of c5d781e0, still wanted keep that in sync
    with termination of daemon parent, so we changed it to:
    
      try:
        fd = open("/dev/fuse")
        mount("-oopts,fd=%s" % fd ...)
        pid = fork(
          # in child
          mount(8) -f
        )
      except:
        sp = socketpair()
        env _FUSE_COMMFD=sp fusermount -oopts
        fd = receive_fd(sp)
    
      daemonize(
        fuse_loop(fd)
      )
      waitpid(pid)
      exit()
    
    (Note the new approch came only to direct [privileged] mount, so fusermount
    based mounting was already partially broken.)
    
    As of 7d0397c2, with the purpose of facilitating async mount, the event flow
    was practically reduced to:
    
      fd = open("/dev/fuse")
      fork(
        mount("-oopts,fd=%s" % fd ...)
        fork(
          mount(8) -n
        )
      )
    
      daemonize(
        fuse_loop(fd)
      )
      exit()
    
    Thus fusermount based mounting become defunct; however, the dead
    code was still kept around. So, we should either drop it or fix
    it. Also, the mtab manipulator is forked into yet another child
    with no purpose, while syncing with it in daemon parent is broken.
    mount(2) is neither synced with parent.
    
    Now we are coming to the following scheme:
    
      fd = open("/dev/fuse")
      pid = fork(
        try:
          mount("-oopts,fd=%s" % fd ...)
          mount(8) -n
        except:
          env _FUSE_DEVFD=fd fusermount -oopts
      )
    
      where fusermount(1) does:
        fd = getenv("_FUSE_DEVFD")
        mount("-oopts,fd=%s" % fd ...)
    
      daemonize(
        fuse_loop(fd)
      )
      waitpid(pid)
      exit()
    
    Nb.:
    
    - We can't help losing compatibility with upstream fusermount,
      as it sends back the fd only when mount(2) is completed,
      thus defeating the async mount approach. The
      'getenv("_FUSE_DEVFD")' mechanism is specfic to glusterfs'
      fusermount (at the moment -- sure we can talk about it with
      upstream)
    
    - fusermount opens /dev/fuse at same privilege level as of
      original process², so we can bravely go on with doing the open
      unconditionally in original process
    
    - Original mounting code actually tries to mount through
      fusermount _twice_: if first attempt fails, then, assuming
      subtype support is missing in kernel, it tries again subtype
      stripped. However, this is redundant, as fusermount internally
      also performs the subtype check³. Therefore we simplified the
      logic to have just a single fusermount call.
    
    - we revert the changes to mount.glusterfs as of 7d0397c2, as
      now there is no issue with glusterfs to work around in that scope

    geo-rep / gsyncd: recognize ECONNABORTED as termination of aux glusterfs
    
    Don't dump stack, rather log the "glusterfs session went down" message.
    
    If the aux glusterfs is already dead when we try to do some file
    operation, we get a failure with ENOTCONN, which is already handled
    as above. However, it's also possible that glusterfs dies while we
    are in a syscall into it -- in that case we get ECONNABORTED, and
    so far then we end up with an ugly stack strace. From now on we
    take ECONNABORTAD as well into consideration.
    
    Nb. wrt. testing: it's not easy to synthetically force the aux glusterfs
    to end this way; for that we have to provoke gsyncd into intensive
    synchronization. I succeeded in that with the following ruby oneliner:
    
    ruby -rcgi -e '
      Dir.chdir($*[0])
      a=[]
      Thread.new { loop { while a.size >= 100; File.delete a.shift; end; sleep 1 }}
      loop { a<<CGI.escape(STDIN.read 10); open(a[-1], "w") {}}' MTPT < /dev/urandom
    
    where the geo-rep master is mounted at MTPT. With this going on, deliver a
    SIGKILL to the geo-rep session's aux glusterfs. (It is giving ECONNABORTED
    non-deterministically, actually in the minority of cases.)

    storage/posix,fuse-bridge: fill the d_type attribute in READDIRP replies
    
    d_type should contain the type of the the dir-entry (man 3 readdir).
    Currently the d_type is always set to DT_UNKNOWN (0). The POSIX standard
    readdir() returns a 'struct dirent' on both Linux and NetBSD with the
    d_type attribute.
    
    Commit bb315cb180c3547218b5ed581d38e76aec74cf94 removed setting d_type
    in xlators/mount/fuse/src/fuse-bridge.c. This was using
    d_type_from_stat(). The stat() seems to have been removed for
    performance reasons. Instead of removing d_type completely,
    dirent->d_type could have been used. Therefore the fuse-brige can now
    add "fde->type = entry->d_type" back into fuse_readdir_cbk() without
    causing the previous performance impact.

    cluster/afr: Enforce order in pre/post op
    
    The xattrop order in pre/post op on all the subvols
    is client-0, client-1... client-n where n is (replica-count - 1).
    This order can lead to invalid split-brains if the brick
    dies in the middle of xattrops.
    
    Example: transaction completed pre-op, so on all the subvolumes
    xattrs have '1' changelog. Now post-op is sent to both the subvols.
    On subvol-0 change-log of client-0 is decremented to 0, before
    decrementing change-log of client-1 to 0 the brick dies.
    This change-log status on subvol-0 gives the meaning that a
    change is done on subvol-0 successfully but on subvol-1 it failed.
    Which is not what happened.
    Changes done when the subvol-0 was down will lead to pending
    change-log on subvol-1 for subvol-0. Which is correct.
    When the subvol-0 is brought back up, the change-log will be in
    split-brain state even when it is not a legitimate split-brain.
    
    If the brick dies in the middle of xattrops it should remain fool.
    Pre-op should perform xattrop of the local change-log first and
    post-op should perform xattrop of the local change-log last.
    In case of optimistic changelogs txn_changelog should be done
    last on local if it succeeds, first if it fails.

    glusterd, cli: Enable errstr for peer probe
    
    Presently glusterd only returns an errno to cli for peer probe command. This
    patch allows glusterd to return an errstr as well to cli. An op_errstr member
    has been added to gf1_cli_probe_rsp and gd1_mgmt_probe_rsp structs to allow
    this.
    In case of an error, cli will display the errstr if it was set. If errstr is not
    set cli will display the error message based on errno.
    Also, to allow for return of errstr in cases such as handshake failure, an
    errstr member has been added to the glusterd_peerctx_t struct.

    Provide missing basename_r and dirname_r
    
    Some systems (e.g.: NetBSD) do not have thread-safe basename(3) and
    dirname(3). This is fine with OpenGroup's Single Unix Specification
    which allows these functions to use static storage. Unfortunately,
    glusterfs uses them a lot and assume thread-safety.
    
    This patch brings FreeBSD's thread-safe basename_r(3) and dirname_r(3)
    in the contrib directory, and tweaks the build process so that
    NetBSD builds use them instead of libc basename(3) and dirname(3)

    Fixed a memory leak in stripe translator.
    
    When iobuf is created it has reference count = 1.
    After iobref_add (local->iobref, iobuf); reference count becomes 2.
    After iobref_unref(local->iobref); it becomes 1 and never becomes 0.
    So iobuf never deletes and this causes a memory leak.
    
    I emulated it, creating files on brick manually.
    After 5 mins of:
    while true; do dd if=file of=/dev/zero bs=16384; done
    top showed me this:
    4618 root      20   0 1721m 1.5g 1868 S  0.0 16.2   5:41.77 glusterfs
    
    1.5 gb of memory has leaked.
    
    For what this if for? Can it be true in the normal conditions?
    if ((local->replies[i].op_ret < local->replies[i].requested_size) &&
        (local->stbuf_size > (local->offset + op_ret))) {
    May be delete it entirely?

    libglusterfs/fd: while dumping the fd_ctx use fd->xl_count
    
    While dumping the fd_ctx when statedump is issued fd->xl_count should be
    used to determine the number of xlators instead of using latest graph's count,
    since while creating the fd only those many slots would have been allocated
    as the number of xlators in the graph at that instant. Then the graph would have
    changed, thus the xl count.
    
    All the above things should happen before any operation is done on fd, otherwise
    fd_ctx_set will allocate the extra slots for the new xlators present in the
    graph.
    
    Also added the program which can be used to reproduce the bug.

    nfs/nlm: procedures for PC clients
    
    *  This change introduces four NLMv4 procedures:
    
       NM_LOCK, SHARE, UNSHARE and FREE_ALL.
    
       These are used by PC clients (windows/dos) to control access
       to files.
    
       1. NM_LOCK: this lock is not monitored by statd.
    
       2. SHARE: A share reservation is a lock on the whole file
          that is taken whenever a file is opened on windows clients.
          This has ACCESS (N, R, W, RW) and DENY MODE (N, R, W, RW).
            ACCESS:    mode of access requested by the client;
            DENY MODE: what the requesting client wants to
                       deny other clients.
    
       3. UNSHARE: remove a share reservation obtained by SHARE.
          Called while closing a file.
    
       4. FREE_ALL: remove all share reservations and locks,
          both monitored and unmonitored, of the calling client.
    
    *  lock and nm_lock use a common function with only
       a flag conveying whether or not to monitor a lock.
    
    *  NOTES:
       1. SHARE reservations are not STACK_WIND'd to subsequent xlators.
          These are maintained in-memory in the nfs xlator.
    
       2. Consequently, for SHARE reservations to work effectively,
          all PC clients  *must* mount from the same gNfs server.
          Not doing so will result in different servers maintaining
          separate SHARE reservations which will not be enforced
          for obvious reasons.

    glusterd: Fixed glusterd_brick_create_path algo.
    
    - check if any prefix of the brick path has "trusted.gfid"
      or "trusted.glusterfs.volume-id" set.
    - set trusted.glusterfs.volume-id on the bricks as soon as
      its induction into the volume is settled. Earlier, the setting of
      "volume-id" used to happen during the first run of the brick process,
      leaving of window for bricks part of one volume to be (ab)used by another
      volume inadvertently.
    - removed creation of brick directory (if missing), during start volume force.
      This is to avoid directory creation as part 'force'ful starting of volume
      and leave the responsibility with the user, who understands the
      'availability' of the export directory (brick) better.

    fuse-resolve: Attempt fd-migration in resolver, if migration
    was never attempted.
    
    Since fd is always associated with an inode, we can create an
    fd only after resolver resolves an inode. So, there is a possibility
    that graph-switch can happen after resolver kicks in, but before
    it can complete, thereby resulting in the newly created fd not
    migrated to new graph. So, instead of migrating fds only during
    graph-switch, we give a second chance during fd-resolution.
    
    As an example, consider following sequence of events during a
    create call:
    1. create wants to resolve parent inode, hence it starts
       resolution for parent
    2. graph-switch happens (it can happen since fuse-request reader
       thread returns after winding lookup calls)
    3. fd-migration of all the fds which are currently in fdtable is
       attempted (Note that the fd corresponding to current create call
       is not yet created and added to fd-table, hence it will not be
       migrated as part of graph switch)
    4. resolution of parent triggered as part of create, completes
    5. fd is created in fuse_create_resume and this fd is not migrated
       to new graph
    6. Any future fops on this fd will fail with EBADF errors
       (create call itself will succeed)

    features/marker: use the gfid from the stat structure instead of inode
    
    in fresh lookup, the inode would not have linked to the inode table
    until the fop reaches back to protocol/server, thus it would not contain
    the gfid within it (gfid would still be null). So use the stat structure
    to get the gfid in lookup callback instead of inode's gfid.

    mgmt/glusterd: Avoid re-starting nfs unconditionally.
    
    NFS server is restarted unconditionally when a volume option is
    configured through the set interface. This patch prevents restart
    of NFS server when operations are performed on translators that
    are not part of the NFS graph.
    
    This does not prevent re-start of a NFS server when an option

    When parent is root, the parent inode returned will always be

    quick-read, md-cache: selectively cache xattr data to conserve memory
    
    The md-cache translator can cache items for a long period of time and
    thus is sensitive to memory usage associated with the items it
    references. This implements two changes to help conserve memory:
    
    - quick-read - Migrate the file content data to a local dict and
    	delete from the xdata dict that passes through the stack.
    - md-cache - Create a local dict to selectively store the xattr
    	data md-cache is interested in. This includes a slight
    	optimization to not allocate an empty dict in the case
    	where we have not received any xattr's of interest.
    
    I've tested both changes independently and together by running a
    readdirp test against several compiled source trees (~340k files).
    The base test results in a 7.7GB RSS on the client. The quick-read
    modification cuts RSS down to 4.1GB, which is still large due
    to md-cache unintelligently caching a large number of empty
    dictionaries. The combined modification cuts RSS down to 462MB
    on the same workload.
    
    NOTE: Theoretically the md-cache change should supercede the
    quick-read change, but practically I save an extra 150MB or so with
    both. I already had the change and consider it an improvement that
    quick-read clean up after itself.

    libgluster: Fix counting, synctask state errors
    
    When a synctask is executed in synctask_switchto, if by the time
    it goes to check the woken/sleep part a reply already comes and
    __wake is called, already running task is going to be put in runq
    this generates a false warning "re-running already running task".
    
    If the reply does not come before the woken/sleep check, then the
    running task is put in waitq which decrements env->runcount even
    when the task is not in runq, this leads to -ve runcount everytime
    a task goes from runq->switchto->waitq.
    
    This patch fixes both of them by introducing a new state for the
    task called SYNCTASK_SUSPEND just when the task is suspended before
    yeild in SYNCOP.

    While setting fd_ctx, if we have to scale the fd contexts, then we get the
    xl_count of the new graph and reallocate the memory for contexts so that
    it is suffecient for contexts of xlators of both new as well as old graph, and
    then initialize the new graph xlator contexts. For that we are considering the
    old pointer itself, instead of using newly reallocated pointer.

    mount/fuse: unref the fds after they have been migrated to the new graph
    
    In fuse upon graph changes fds were being migrated to the new graph.
    It was done by taking all the fds from the fdtable in a structure and then
    migrating each fd in the structure to the new graph. But after the fds
    are migrated the structure which had the fds within it (that is refed fds)
    was being freed without unrefing the fds, thus leading to a fd leak.

    statedump: fix deadlock during state dump of fds
    
    Existing state dump of FD context tries to be extra safe by trying
    to call the fd dump callback outside the inode lock. It acheives
    this by taking an fd ref and unreffing it later. This exercise can
    be harmful at times when the fd unref performed by state dump ends
    up being the last unref and triggers fd_destroy. fd_destroy in turn
    triggers inode_unref which blocks on inode table lock, while the
    inode table lock was already held by the thread before it even
    attempted fd ctx dump.
    
    The fix takes away the dangerous ref/unref of the fd during state
    dump and instead calls fd_ctx_dump() whiel the inode lock is held.
    This is not a problem as long as the dump functions do not call any
    inode function which tries to take an inode lock (none of the
    existing fd dump ops do)

    clean up handling of special client pids
    
    - no need to name a lower boundary [drop GF_CLIENT_PID_MIN]
    - drop utility function to decide about pid speciality [gf_pid_client_check()];
      when we implement uniform policy for special pids, use just comparison with
      GF_CLIENT_PID_MAX (currently such uniform policy exists in io-threads, where
      special clients get lowest priority)
    - io-threads: drop numeric literal, use GF_CLIENT_PID_MAX
    - xattr flipping (in fuse):
      - fuse_xattr_alloc_default() made static
      - avoid compiler warnings wrt. partial enum traversal in the switch
        by not casting the original numeric value to gf_client_pid_t (enum) type
      - trim down the switch to those cases with which there is something to do

    Make option code quieter to make logs more readable.
    
    A lot of this stuff is extremely uninformative, such as messages about
    default values that can be read from the code.  Having them in the logs
    makes more important messages harder to find, so they're down to
    GF_DEBUG_TRACE now.

    cluster/distribute: handle dht_layout_normalize errors differently in
    dht_lookup_dir_cbk and dht_discover_complete.
    
    return value from dht_layout_normalize is interpreted as follows:
    
    ret > 0 - number of subvolumes returned ENOENT errors.
    ret = 0 - no anomalies found.
    ret < 0 - there are holes/overlaps.
    
    We need to handle errors differently in dht_discover_cbk because,
    if a subvolume is newly added, the directory will not be present on it
    and we cannot create a directory there since a nameless lookup has
    resulted execution in this code-path. Hence if directory is guaranteed
    to be present in atleast one subvolume and there are no holes/overlaps
    in the layout, lookup can be treated as successful.
    
    there is no change in behaviour dht_lookup_dir_cbk caused by this
    patch.

    cluster/afr: Handle transient parent-entry xactions in lookup
    
    This patch addresses the case when the lookup on an entry is performed
    while it is being renamed. The lookup can possibly return 2 different
    gfids when lookup on one subvol reached before rename and on other
    after rename. In such cases the conflicting entry self-heal is
    triggered to resolve the issue, but if there are lot entry transactions
    going on the parent directory of the entry then the non-blocking
    locks could fail resulting in EIO. To avoid this, lookup queries
    locks xlator if there are any parent-entrylk on entry's basename.
    If afr finds that there are such locks and gfids are differing then
    it chooses the file with latest ctime as the iatt of the entry.
    This solution is not foolproof, but it decreases the probability of
    hitting the EIO. The correct solution is to take blocking locks on
    the parent-entry to find out the correct source. Taking blocking
    locks in lookup is not good. One stale entry lock can hang the whole
    filesystem. So we chose to go with this for now.

    glusterd (remove-brick): fix data-loss issue
    
    * when more than one brick (more than one distribute subvolume)
      was removed using single command, rebalance process used to
      get started only on one node, causing data-loss when 'commit'
      was done, because the brick's data was not migrated at all.
      Fixed the logic of validating rebalance required in remove-
      brick case.

    glusterd : Fixes for breakages caused by volume-id validation
    
    Fixes glusterd_op_build_payload() to,
    1. take account of status cmd type when building payload for "volume status" to
       prevent "volume status all" from failing.
    2. take account of volname being "help/help-xml" in volume set to prevent
       "volume set help/help-xml" from failing
    3. obtain volname using key "master" prevent "volume geo-replication" commands
       from failing
    
    Also, fails op and sets correct op_errstr if volume not found during
    glusterd_dict_set_volid(), to make sure cli displays proper message.

    mount.glusterfs: multiple fixes
    
    * noticed that the regex to parse the options were not fool proof.
      for example, 'ro' in a logfilename could have made the mount
      point read-only. Now fixed.
    
    * this issue existed for 'acl', 'worm' options.
    
    * log-server/log-server-port options were legacy, and no more
      needed in codebase.
    
    * refactored option processing in general to avoid above issues

    glusterd: Added volume-id to 'op' dictionary
    
    Volume-id passed in op dictionary would help detect possible split brains
    among peers in a cluster. The idea is to check if the volume's id and
    the vol-id that was passed are equal.
    ie, same volume name, but different volume id indicate that glusterd
    'metadata' of one of the participating peers is stale or there is
    a split brain.
    
    This is over and above the existing checksum based validation of peer
    supplied cluster 'metadata' (ie, volume info file).

    md-cache: fix dict memory leak in mdc_inode_xatt_update
    
    We currently either dict_ref() or dict_copy() into mdc->xattr.
    The double dict_ref() call path is obvious. Alternatively,
    dict_copy() does not ref the dict in the situation where it
    creates a new dict, but we only call dict_copy() in this
    context when we already have a dict, which should mean the
    extra ref is unnecessary.

commit 69f70038171862daedcbbccf0eaba3d1f8d885f5
Author: Kaleb KEITHLEY <kkeithle@redhat.com>

    Replace GPLV3 MD5 with OpenSSL MD5
    
    Ric asked me to look at replacing the GPL licensed MD5 code with
    something better, i.e. perhaps faster, and with a less restrictive
    license, etc. So I took a couple hour holiday from working on
    wrapping up the client_t and did this.
    
    OpenSSL (nee SSLeay) is released under the OpenSSL license, a BSD/MIT
    style license. OpenSSL (libcrypto.so) is used on Linux, OS X and *BSD,
    Open Solaris, etc. IOW it's universally available on the platforms we
    care about. It's written by Eric Young (eay), now at EMC/RSA, and I
    can say from experience that the OpenSSL implementation of MD5 (at least)
    is every bit as fast as RSA's proprietary implementation (primarily
    because the implementations are very, very similar.) The last time I
    surveyed MD5 implementations I found they're all pretty much the same
    speed.
    
    I changed the APIs (and ABIs) for the strong and weak checksums.
    Strictly speaking I didn't need to do that. They're only called on
    short strings of data, i.e. pathnames, so using int32_t and uint32_t
    is ostensibly okay. My change is arguably a better, more general API
    for this sort of thing. It's also what bit me when gerrit/jenkins
    validation failed due to glusterfs segv-ing. (I didn't pay close enough
    attention to the implementation of the weak checksum. But it forced me
    to learn what gerrit/jenkins are doing and going forward I can do better
    testing before submitting to gerrit.)
    
    Now resubmitting with a BZ

    glusterd: Added init scripts like interface for gluster commands
    
    Directories to hold the scripts mentioned above would be created for each
    gluster command under glusterd's 'working dir' as follows:
    (eg.)
    <glusterd-working-dir>/hooks/version/create/pre
    
    <glusterd-working-dir>/hooks/version/create/post
    
    where, version corresponds to the version of hook scripts.
    
    The scripts beginning with 'S' under the above directories would be run before
    (pre) and after (post) the volume created. The scripts would receive a command
    line argument as below:
    --volname=<volname>
    
    This can be optionally used  by the script.

    The major changes are,
    * "volume status" now supports getting details of the self-heal daemon processes
    for replica volumes. A new cli options "shd", similar to "nfs", has been
    introduced for this. "detail", "fd" and "clients" status ops are not supported
    for self-heal daemons.
    * The default/normal ouput of "volume status" has been enhanced to contain
    information about nfs-server and self-heal daemon processes as well. Some tweaks
    have been done to the cli output to show appropriate output.
    
    Also, changes have been done to rebalance/remove-brick status, so that hostnames
    are displayed instead of uuids.

    The final fstat which makes the call_count 0 could be a failure.
    In that case the buf could either be NULL or buf is all zeros.
    If buf is NULL then it will crash, if it is all zeros
    buf->ia_type will be IA_INVAL and it proceeds to special file fix.
    sh->type is assigned with the ia_type of the file to be healed.
    I modified the code to depend on that instead.

    protocol/client: Set grace_timer_needed flag to false on a disconnect.
    
    A grace timer is registered on a disconnect, but a reconnect timer sends a
    connect request after every 3sec and if the server is down, the client protocol
    receives disconnect and a grace timer will be registered which on timeout will
    increase the lk-version value. Its enough to register the grace timer once after
    the first disconnect and later just ignore other psuedo disconnects until the
    next successful reconnect.

    glusterd: Fixed replace-brick commit_force algo.
    
    - commit force subcommand of replace-brick (rb) should be allowed
      even if source brick is (irrecoverably) offline.
    - modified rb_timer to be active only for start subcommand. This is
      important since, the rb timer event relies on src_brick and dst_brick
      objects to be 'alive' when it 'happens'. In the case of
      abort/commit/commit force it is very likely that src_brick and/or
      dst_brick objects could have been destroyed.

    rpc-clnt: separate out connection_cleanup() from destroy()
    
    noticed that there are possibilities where one would like to do a
    connection_cleanup() before destroying a RPC connection itself, also
    current code is such that, rpc_clnt_connection_cleanup() does
    rpc_clnt_ref() and unref(), creating a race window/double unref
    possibilities in the code.
    
    by separating out the functions, this race window/double fault can be
    prevented.

    protocol/client: Handle failures in lock self healing gracefully (part 1).
    
    During reopening of fd's and reacquiring of locks on the fd (after a
    reconnect), a release on a fd on which reacquiring of locks is in progress
    will free up fdctx. This patch will keep fdctx valid until the reacquiring
    of locks is in progress.

    cluster/stripe: fix {set/get}xattr query for dirs/symlink
    
    This patch fixes the following problems:
    * ENOENT returned for getxattr (xtime) on symlinks
        Non-data entities are created only on the first subvolume but
        getxattr fop winds to all subvols. This results in all subvols
        except the first one to return ENOENT which is propogated down
        the stack.
    
    * ENODATA returned for getxattr (xtime) on directory
        setxattr calls always wind to the first stripe subvolume.
        xtime getxattr invocation winds to all subvolumes but the
        xattr is present in only the first one, resulting in all
        subvols except the first one to return ENODATA.
    
    Fix
    
      For symlinks getxattr now always winds to the first subvol and
      for directories setxattr sets the xattr on all subvols.
    
    NOTE
    
       For directories the all-subvol-wind in setxattr is done
       only when request is from a special client (client-pid == -1)

    protocol/server: send forget on the renamed inode
    
    If rename is given on a file "a" to "b" ("b" is already existing file),
    then after rename, the inode for "b" would still be in the inode table
    and would not get forget (for fuse client, the fuse kernel module would
    send, but on server forget will not come on that inode), thus leading
    to inode leak even when the mount point is empty.
    
    To avoid that before doing inode rename, unlink the previous inode that
    "b" is pointing to and send forget on that, if "b" is the last dentry
    for that inode.

    Updated the Ubuntu upstart jobs for glusterd in extras/Ubuntu.
    
    Using upstart jobs, instead of an initscript, solves Bug 765014.
    See also: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/glusterfs/+bug/876648
    
    The new upstart jobs split the work of starting glusterd & mounting glusterfs volumes into two parts: a glusterd service runner and a glusterfs volume moung blocker which waits for the service runner.
    
    This is the method preferred by Ubuntu developers to block a mounting event until a required service is available.  These changes will be included in the Ubuntu glusterfs-server package starting with release 12.04, Precise Pangolin.
    
    Tested on Ubuntu 12.04

    Change option brick-with-valgrind to run-with-valgrind
    
    brick-with-valgrind does not make much sense because all the
    glusterfs/glusterfsd server processes are run with valgrind.
    So changing the option from brick-with-valgrind to
    run-with-valgrind.
    Also fix misspelt 'valgrnd' for valgrind log file namenames.

    protocol/server: add and remove the transports from the list, inside the lock
    
    Till now for graph changes, glusterfs client used to remember the old graph
    also. Hence the transport object on the server corresponding the old graph
    never received disconnect. But now since the graph cleanup is happening,
    transport on the server side gets disconnect for the cleaned up graph.
    
    Server maintains, all the transports in a list. But addition of the new
    transport to the list, or removal of the transport from the list is not
    happening within the lock. Thus if a thread is accessing a transport
    (in cases of statedump, where each transprt's information is dumped),
    and the server gets a disconnect on that transport, then it leads to
    segfault of the process.
    
    To avoid it do the list (of transports) manipulation inside the lock.

    protocol/server: Avoid race in add/del locker, connection_cleanup
    
    conn->ltable address keeps changing in
    server_connection_cleanup every time it is called.
    i.e. New ltable is created every time it is called.
    Here is the race that happened:
    ---------------------------------------------------
    thread-1                        | thread-2
    add_locker is called with       |
    conn->ltable. lets call the     |
    ltable address lt1              |
                                    | connection cleanup is called
                                    | and do_lock_table_cleanup is
                                    | triggered for lt1. locker
                                    | lists are splice_inited under
                                    | the lt1->lock
    lt1 adds the locker under       |
    lt1->lock (lets call this l1)   |
                                    | GF_FREE(lt1) happens in
                                    | do_lock_table_cleanup
    
    The locker l1 that is added just before lt1 is freed will never
    be cleared in the subsequent server_connection_cleanups as there
    does not exist a reference to the locker. The stale lock remains
    in the locks xlator even though the transport on which it was
    issued is destroyed.

    core: bring a cmdline option to set memory-accounting
    
    currently this is implemented as a command line option, and not
    as an easier translator option. this is because as of now, before
    even the volume files are parsed, we would need memory accounting
    enabled. there is scope for improving this behavior, but for now,
    this approach solves the problem.
    
    Also, this feature's major consumers are the testers who are
    looking for leaks, hence option is hidden from usage output.

    nfs: do not call inode_path on the newly created inode
    
    While resolving, for building the path into the loc, inode_find
    is called with gfid as argument to get the inode from the inode
    table. If the inode is not found, then a new inode is created.
    Then the path is build using inode_path. But if the inode is
    not linked to inode table (newly created inode), then gfid will
    be null and inode_path returns null gfid as the path. Suppose the
    lookup operation on that gfid fails, then we print the null gfid
    in the log message.
    
    To avoid it, build the path using the gfid only if inode_path
    fails.

    cluster/afr: handle sending NULL dentry name for inode link in self-heal-daemon
    
    * Without the dentry name, dentry cannot be created in inode_link, which
     leads to trying to access the null dentry to check if it is cyclic and
     thus segfault. So send the parent inode also NULL, which just returns
     the proper inode after assigning the gfid and type to the inode without
     trying to create dentry.
    
    * Handle failures such as dentry_create returning NULL, in inode_link
      properly and return NULL in such cases.
    
    * Increase the lru limit of inode table of self-heal-daemon to 2048

    cli, glusterd, nfs: "volume status|profile|top" for nfs servers
    
    Enables usage of volume monitoring operations "volume status", "volume top" and
    "volume profile" for nfs servers. These operations can be performed on
    nfs-servers  by passing "nfs" as an option in cli. The output is similar to the
    normal brick outputs for these commands.
    
    The new syntaxes for the changed commands are as below,
     #gluster volume profile <VOLNAME> {start|info|stop} [nfs]
     #gluster volume top <VOLNAME> {[open|read|write|opendir|readdir [nfs]]

    protocol/server: Remove connection from conf->conns w.o. race
    
    1) Adding the connection to conf->conns used to
    happen in conf->mutex, but removing happened under conn->lock.
    Fixed that as below.
    When the connection object is created conn's ref, bind_ref count
    is set to '1'. For bind_ref ref/unref happens under conf->mutex
    whenever server_connection_get, put is called.
    When bind_ref goes to '0' connection object is removed from
    conf->conns under conf->mutex.  After it is removed from the list,
    conn_unref is called outside the conf->mutex.
    conn_ref/unref still happens under conn->lock.
    
    2) Fixed races in server_connection_cleaup in grace_timer_handler
    and server_setvolume.

    cluster/afr: save the xattr obtained in the {f}xattrop_cbk in local
    
    If the {f}xattrop operation succeeds on one of the subvolumes and fails
    on another (thus the xattr dict obtained from the failed subvolume in
    the callback will be NULL), then afr would be unwinding with op_ret = 0
    (since the operation was successful on one subvolume), but the xattr dict
    would be NULL (afr is not saving the xattr it has received in the callback
    in its local structure and will send the xattr it has received in the last
    callback). xlators above afr might segfault when they access the xattr since
    they would have assumed that xattr would be present as op_ret is 0.

    glusterd: Peer(s) mustn't send updates about members not yet in cluster
    
    Also, peerinfo is added to peers list synchoronous with the request triggering
    it. This ensures that atmost one request sees that the peer (in question) is
    not in peers list.  Earlier, 'concurrent' handle_friend_update requests would
    see that a particular peer is not in the peers list yet, as the addition of the
    'peer' into the list happened asynchronously, on the 'connect' event of the
    'peer'.

    When a transaction is in progress lookup depends on inode ctx
    for read-child. If the lookup fails on the read-child while
    another transaction is in progress, it should select the
    read-child as the next success_child which is in fresh_children.

    cluster/afr: copy the parent's gfid from child loc while building parent loc
    
    Suppose the process is not a fuse or nfs mounted client, and some other process
    such as rebalance, then after lookups inode would not be linked to the inode
    table (since the inode was created for rebalance purpose only), thus keeping
    inode's gfid NULL.
    
    And afr while building the parent loc using child loc, does not copy the
    pargfid present in child'd loc structure. protocol/client will search for
    the gfid either in loc or in loc->inode and assert if it cannot find the
    gfid in either of them.

    transport/socket: configuring tcp window-size
    
    Till now, send and recieve buffer window sizes for sockets
    were set to a default glusterfs-specific value.
    Linux's default window sizes have been found to be better
    w.r.t performance, and hence, no more setting it to any
    default value.
    
    However, if one wishes, there's the new configuration option:
       network.tcp-window-size <sane_size>
    which takes a size value (int or human readable) and will set
    the window size of sockets for both clients and servers.
    Nfs clients will also be updated with the same.

    cli: print the type of the inode in gluster volume status inode output
    
    Instead of a number print the type of the inode in the output of
    gluster volume status inode. This is what the output symbols indicate.
    
    R -----> Regular file
    D -----> Directory
    L -----> symbolic Link
    B -----> Block special device
    C -----> Character special device
    F -----> FIFO
    S -----> Socket
    I -----> Invalid inode type
    
    Also supress a warning message displayed at the time of build.

    core: utilize mempool for frame->local allocations
    
    in each translator, which uses 'frame->local', we are using
    GF_CALLOC/GF_FREE, which would be costly considering the
    number of allocation happening in a lifetime of 'fop'. It
    would be good to utilize the mem pool framework for xlator's
    local structures, so there is no allocation overhead.

    fuse-bridge: Handle graph-switch.
    
    The purpose of this patch is to let protocol/client know when its transports can
    be disconnected, without application running on gluster mount noticing any
    effects of graph switch.
    
    In order to do this, we migrate all fds and blocked locks to new graph.
    Once this migration is complete and there are no in-transit frames as viewed
    by fuse-bridge, we send a PARENT_DOWN event to its children. protocol/client
    on receiving this event, can disconnect up its transports.

    md-cache: meta-data caching translator
    
    This is a metadata caching translator which is well integrated with
    glusterfs core framework and leverages some of the recent protocol
    changes to do a better job at caching.
    
    - It uses the attributes returned along callbacks of all calls to
      update its attribute cache as frequently as possible without
      issuing calls on its own (i.e, very low overhead)
    
    - It caches attributes returned via readdirp into the inode contexts
      corresponding to those entries (i.e, well integrated)
    
    - It caches and updates xattrs and not just inode attributes (i.e,
      eliminates the need for a separate xattr-prefetch translator)
    
    In its current form it has a timeout based consistency model

    syncop: Multi-processor support in syncenv
    
    This patch introduces:
    
    - multithreading of syncop processors permitting synctasks to be executed
      concurrently if the runqueue has many tasks.
    
    - Auto scaling of syncop processors based on runqueue length.
    
    - Execute a synctask (synctask_new) in a blocking way if callback function
      is set NULL. The return value of the syncfn will be the return value
      of synctask_new()

    protocol/client,server: fcntl lock self healing.
    
    Currently(with out this patch), on a disconnect the server cleans up
    the transport which inturn closes the fd's and releases the locks acquired on
    those fd's by that client. On a reconnect, client just reopens the fd's but
    doesn't reacquire the locks. The application that had previously acquired
    the locks still is under the assumption that it is the owner of those locks
    which might have been granted to other clients(if they request) by the server
    leading to data corruption.
    
    This patch allows the client to reacquire the fcntl locks (held on the fd's)
    during client-server handshake.
    
    * The server identifies the client via process-uuid-xl (which is a combination
      of uuid and client-protocol name, it is assumed to be unique) and lk-version
      number.
    
    * The client maintains a list of process-uuid-xl, lk-version pair for each
      accepted connection. On a connect, the server traverses the list for a
      matching pair, if a matching pair is not found the the server returns
      lk-version with value 0, else it returns the lk-version it has in store.
    
    * On a disconnect, the server and client enter grace period, and on the
      completion of the grace period, the client bumps up its lk-version number
      (which means, it will reacquire the locks the next time) and the server will
      distroy the connection. If reconnection happens within the grace period, the
      server will find the matching (process-uuid-xl, lk-version) pair in its list
      which guarantees that the fd's and there corresponding locks are still valid
      for this client.
    
    Configurable options:
      To set grace-timeout, the following options are
        option server.grace-timeout value
        option client.grace-timeout value
    
      To enable or disable the lk-heal,
        option lk-heal [on|off]
    
    gluster volume set command can be used to configurable options

    glusterd: auth allow enhancements
    
    * PROBLEM:
    
      When address-based authentication is enabled on a volume,
      the gNfs server, self-heal daemon (shd), and other operations
      such as quota, rebalance, replace-brick and geo-replication
      either stop working or the services are not started if all
      the peers' ipv{4,6} addresses or hostnames are not added in
      the "set auth.allow" operation, breaking the functionality
      of several operations.
    
      E.g:
        volume vol in a cluster of two peers:
        /mnt/brick1 in 192.168.1.4
        /mnt/brick2 in 192.168.1.5
    
        option auth.allow 192.168.1.6
        (allow connection requests only from 192.168.1.6)
    
        This will disrupt the nfs servers on 192.168.1.{4,5}.
        brick server processes reject connection requests from both
        nfs servers (on 4,5), because the peer addresses are not in
        the auth.allow list.
    
        Same holds true for local mounts (on peer machines),
        self-heal daemon, and other operations which perform
        a glusterfs mount on one of the peers.
    
    * SOLUTION:
    
      Login-based authentication (username/password pairs,
      henceforth referred to as "keys") for gluster services and
      operations.
    
      These *per-volume* keys can be used to by-pass the addr-based
      authentication, provided none of the peers' addresses are put
      in the auth.reject list, to enable gluster services like gNfs,
      self-heal daemon and internal operations on volumes when
      auth.allow option is exercised.
    
    * IMPLEMENTATION:
    
      1. Glusterd generates keys for each volume and stores it in
         memory as well as in respective volfiles.
         A new TRUSTED-FUSE volfile is generated which is
         fuse volfile + keys in protocol/client,
         and is named trusted-<volname>-fuse.vol.
         This is used by all local mounts. ANY local mount (on any peer)
         is granted the trusted-fuse volfile instead of fuse volfile
         via getspec. non-local mounts are NOT granted the trusted fuse
         volfile.
    
      2. The keys generated for the volume is written to each server
         volfile telling servers to allow users with these keys.
    
      3. NFS, self-heal daemon and replace-brick volfiles are updated
         with the volume's authentication keys.
    
      4. The keys are NOT written to fuse volfiles for obvious reasons.
    
      5. The ownership of volfiles and logfiles is restricted to root users.
    
      6. Merging two identical definitions of peer_info_t in auth/addr
         and rpc-lib, throwing away the one in auth/addr.
    
      7. Code cleanup in numerous places as appropriate.
    
    * IMPORTANT NOTES:
    
      1. One SHOULD NOT put any of the peer addresses in the auth.reject
         list if one wants any of the glusterd services and features
         such as gNfs, self-heal, rebalance, geo-rep and quota.
    
      2. If one wants to use username/password based authentication
         to volumes, one shall append to the server, nfs and shd volfiles,
         the keys one wants to use for authentication, *while_retaining
         those_generated_by_glusterd*.
         See doc/authentication.txt file for details.

    cluster/dht: Support for hardlink rebalance when decommissioning
    
    The support for hardlink rebalance is only available for decommissioning
    of a node. this can be triggered in two ways
    1. remove-brick start
    2. if decommission node value is set in vol file, then a normal rebalance
       command
    
    The way we handle it is-
    if (nlink > 1)
    do
           * if src file doesnt have linkto xattr
                    * mark src's linkto to the dst
           * else
                    * perform a link on the dst
                    * do a look up
                    * if nlinks = dst.nlinks
                            * migrate data

    cli/glusterd: volume status modification
    
    * Method of getting mount details of brick has been
      changed from direct reading of /etc/mtab to using
      libc's <mntent.h>, providing a fairly portable
      version independent of different linux distributions.
      It is only supported on Linux though.
    
    * Wrong fs type (rootfs for /) in fedora-based
      distributions has been fixed.
    
    * Allows options (detail, mem, fd, et al) to "all" volumes.
    
    * Use of the fnmatch's GNU extension flag,
      FNM_LEADING_DIR is restricted to Linux hosts only.
      In case of non-Linux hosts, partial match functionality
      is absent.

    1. Fixes the bug in statedump causing the gluster process to crash when an unknown
    option was given in the 'glusterdump.*.options' file.
    2. Also fixes cli, making it send full statedump option strings even when only
    partial option strings are given in 'volume statedump' command.
    3. Minor change to order of operations during statedump to allow option parsing
    errors to be written to the dump file.

    posix: handle some internal behavior in posix_mknod()
    
    assume a case of link() systemcall, which is handled in distribute by
    creating a 'linkfile' in hashed subvolume, if the 'oldloc' is present
    in different subvolume. we have same 'gfid' for the linkfile as that
    of file for consistency. Now, a file with multiple hardlinks, we may
    end up with 'hardlinked' linkfiles. dht create linkfile using 'mknod()'
    fop, and as now posix_mknod() is not equipped to handle this situation.
    
    this patch fixes the situation by looking at the 'internal' key set in
    the dictionary to differentiate the call which originates from inside
    with regular system calls.

    cli: Enable output in XML
    
    This patch enables gluster cli to output data in xml format. XML output can be
    obtained by passing "--xml" as an argument.
    
    A new "volume list" command, which lists the volumes present in a cluster, has
    been added. This can be used for obtaining a quick list of volumes.
    
    Several commands, including "volume top", "volume profile", "volume status" and
    "volume info", "volume list", have custom XML output routines. Other commands
    use either one of the 2 generic output routines, cli_xml_output_str() &
    cli_xml_output_dict().
    NOTE: When using "all" for "volume status" and "volume info" the XML output will
    have multiple roots.

    protocol xdr: remove 'path<>'
    
    client was sending 'path' on wire, which gets ignored on server

    also with not having path on wire, the xdr size on wire most of the
    time can remain constant, which helps in allocating RDMA buffers.

    fuse: fix resolver to handle graph switches properly
    
    perform resolution on the latest graph by caching it in state->itable
    and use fuse_nodeid as just a hint to the possible final resolved inode
    (in case it was resolved off the latest graph). GFID is the primary key
    for resolving inodes on the latest graph.

    glusterd: Changed op_sm_queue locking mechanism to accomodate nested calls to op_sm
    
    Today if an rpc call made inside an op_sm can fail due to a disconnected peer,
    resulting in the rpc callback to be called in the same stack with appropriate
    status set. All glusterd rpc cbks move the state machine based on the status
    returned by the rpc layer, which would result in a nested call to op_sm. With
    the current scheme of locking, glusterd would end up in a deadlock situation
    
    The new scheme will fail the nested glusterd_op_sm (). This prevents the
    deadlock.  It would work without any change in overall behaviour, as the
    current op_sm () call in execution wouldn't return until all events in the
    queue are processed.

    cli: Extend "volume status" with statedump info
    
    This patch enhances and extends the "volume status" command with information
    obtained from the statedump of the bricks of volumes.
    
    Adds new status types : clients, inode, fd, mem, callpool
    The new syntax of "volume status" is,
     #gluster volume status [all|{<volname> [<brickname>]
                             [misc-details|clients|inode|fd|mem|callpool]}]

    cluster/afr: Perform xattrop with all afr-keys
    
    Self-heal does not happen if the file has change log xattr
    only for one of the subvol keys. This patch makes sure that
    xattrop is done for all the afr subvol keys after a new entry
    is created in entry-self-heal.
    
    1) Added matrix create/cleanup functions
    2) Impunging a new file does multiple xattrops on the source
    subvol, one per sink. The code can do a single xattrop after
    the entry is created on all the sinks.
    3) Missing entry self-heal uses one frame per sink to heal
    the file. This leads to multiple xattrops on the source subvol.
    That code is changed now to use one frame which will
    create the file on all subvols.

commit 7e1f8e3bac201f88e2d9ef62fc69a044716dfced
Author: Anand Avati <avati@gluster.com>
Date:   Fri Jan 13 13:27:15 2012 +0530

    core: GFID filehandle based backend and anonymous FDs
    
    1. What
    --------
    This change introduces an infrastructure change in the filesystem
    which lets filesystem operation address objects (inodes) just by its
    GFID. Thus far GFID has been a unique identifier of a user-visible
    inode. But in terms of addressability the only mechanism thus far has
    been the backend filesystem path, which could be derived from the
    GFID only if it was cached in the inode table along with the entire set
    of dentry ancestry leading up to the root.
    
    This change essentially decouples addressability from the namespace. It
    is no more necessary to be aware of the parent directory to address a
    file or directory.
    
    2. Why
    -------
    The biggest use case for such a feature is NFS for generating
    persistent filehandles. So far the technique for generating filehandles
    in NFS has been to encode path components so that the appropriate
    inode_t can be repopulated into the inode table by means of a recursive
    lookup of each component top-down.
    
    Another use case is the ability to perform more intelligent self-healing
    and rebalancing of inodes with hardlinks and also to detect renames.
    
    A derived feature from GFID filehandles is anonymous FDs. An anonymous FD
    is an internal USABLE "fd_t" which does not map to a user opened file
    descriptor or to an internal ->open()'d fd. The ability to address a file
    by the GFID eliminates the need to have a persistent ->open()'d fd for the
    purpose of avoiding the namespace. This improves NFS read/write performance
    significantly eliminating open/close calls and also fixes some of today's
    limitations (like keeping an FD open longer than necessary resulting
    in disk space leakage)
    
    3. How
    -------
    
    At each storage/posix translator level, every file is hardlinked inside
    a hidden .glusterfs directory (under the top level export) with the name
    as the ascii-encoded standard UUID format string. For reasons of performance
    and scalability there is a two-tier classification of those hardlinks
    under directories with the initial parts of the UUID string as the directory
    names.
    
    For directories (which cannot be hardlinked), the approach is to use a symlink
    which dereferences the parent GFID path along with basename of the directory.
    The parent GFID dereference will in turn be a dereference of the grandparent
    with the parent's basename, and so on recursively up to the root export.
    
    4. Development
    ---------------
    
    4a. To leverage the ability to address an inode by its GFID, the technique is
    to perform a "nameless lookup". This means, to populate a loc_t structure as:
    
    loc_t {
       pargfid: NULL
       parent: NULL
       name: NULL
       path: NULL
       gfid: GFID to be looked up [out parameter]
       inode: inode_new () result [in parameter]
    }
    
    and performing such lookup will return in its callback an inode_t
    populated with the right contexts and a struct iatt which can be
    used to perform an inode_link () on the inode (without a parent and
    basename). The inode will now be hashed and linked in the inode table
    and findable via inode_find().
    
    A fundamental change moving forward is that the primary fields in a
    loc_t structure are now going to be (pargfid, name) and (gfid) depending
    on the kind of FOP. So far path had been the primary field for operations.
    The remaining fields only serve as hints/helpers.
    
    4b. If read/write is to be performed on an inode_t, the approach so far
    has been to: fd_create(), STACK_WIND(open, fd), fd_bind (in callback) and
    then perform STACK_WIND(read, fd) etc. With anonymous fds now you can do
    fd_anonymous (inode), STACK_WIND (read, fd). This results in great boost
    in performance in the inbuilt NFS server.
    
    5. Misc
    -------
    The inode_ctx_put[2] has been renamed to inode_ctx_set[2] to be consistent
    with the rest of the codebase.

    posix-acl: properly process umask in case client sent it
    
    FUSE used to interpret the umask itself. That was a bad idea, since
    there are cases where umask is not applied, such as when extended POSIX
    ACLs are present and default ACLs are set on parent directory.
    
    The FUSE bridge was changed to send original mode with umask (alongside
    masked mode, for compatibility). If that is the case, we decide whether
    to apply the umask or not in the posix-acl translator depending on
    whether a default umask is set, or not.
    
    The original, broken, behavior is preserved in following cases:
    * Unpatched client (not sending umask with original mode)
    * Unpatched server (not understanding umask with original mode)
    * Old FUSE on client side (FUSE < 7.12 or linux < 2.6.31)
      (can not find out the umask and original mode)

    cluster/stripe: Fix block size reported in pathinfo xattr
    
    Block size (or stripe size) is reported when request is made
    for pathinfo xattr (trusted.glusterfs.pathinfo) for a striped
    volume. When the block size is changed, the new block size is
    reported for files created with older block size. This can be
    confusing ( or even erroneous ) for applications relying on
    pathinfo xattr to find chunks in backend.

    protocol/server: Do connection cleanup if reply fails
    
    We observed that after the first connection cleanup happens on
    DISCONNECT the lock calls in transit are granted or added in
    blocked locks queue. These locks were never cleaned up after that
    because no unlock would come up on that connection. This would
    leave references on that transport so it would never be destroyed.
    Now, the connection cleanup happens whenever the reply
    submission fails.
    
    Also cleaned up the old code which is not used any more.

    glusterd: Fixed spurious checks in add_brick.
    
    Previous algo,
     - didn't allow volume type change from plain distribute
       to distribute-[stripe][-][replicate].
     - performed 'add-brick' on temporary volinfo without correct
       initialisations. This was superflous.

    showing the proper usage of volume set, instead of sending the

    bz 3826, fix for parallel make in fedora build system
    
    builds of glusterfs in the fedora build system often fail due to a
    race condition between running yacc and starting to compile the y.tab.c
    produced by yacc
    
    We found that the previous fix would still occasionally trip the race
    condition. This revised patch changes the automake Makefile.am to generate
    the parser files without incurring the race condition. An extra dimension
    of the problem is that the tarball from
      http://download.gluster.com/pub/gluster/glusterfs/3.2/3.2.5/glusterfs-3.2.5.tar.gz
    contains files that you don't get when you clone from the git repo (e.g.
    libgluster/src/{graph.lex.c,y.tab.c}, and all the Makefile.in files) so
    build issues on fedora build systems do not manifest themselves on jenkins
    and vice versa.
    
    This works on jenkins, the fedora build system, and my f16 vm/guest
    machines. (Finding the right combination that works on all three was an
    exercise to say the least. I'm open to other suggestions for avoiding
    the race condition.)
    
    Run autogen.sh to (re)generate the Makefile.ins. Then run configure to
    produce all Makefiles, followed by `make -j X` where X>1

commit 5aed416a5f61b18a7eb105fde0752d1f66c37a88

Date:   Wed Nov 23 00:02:33 2011 +0530

    Change the start/stop order of glusterd script at boot time.
    
    In cases of client and server sharing the same machine, mounting GlusterFS at
    boot time failed due to the start and stop order we use for glusterd. And people
    had to resort to the idea of adding mount command in rc.local.
    
    Currently the start and stop order at the boot time were 90 and 12, and netfs
    started before `glusterd' and failed to mount GlusterFS. By changing
    the rc order to 20 80 glusterd is started earlier than netfs, thus enabling
    netfs to mount GlusterFS during boot process.
    
    Thanks to: alex@net13.info for the suggestion in bug 2484.

    This change is required as increasingly large number of small files

    It is highly necessary to support algorithmic checking of inodes too
    just as we do for disk space.

    cli_cmd_submit calls cli_cmd_lock, but cli_cmd_unlock is done in
    cli_cmd_await_response. It is clearer to do the locking and unlocking in
    the same function.
    
    Only cli_cmd_submit seems to call cli_cmd_await_response, therefore
    moving the cli_cmd_unlock to cli_cmd_submit should be safe.

    xlator: prevent a crash in xlator_destroy due to uninitialized list
    
    was happening when any of the dlopen() fails for xlator loading, and
    xlator_destroy() was called as it was using a uninitialized list for
    traversal.
    
    now, the list gets initialized at the begining of the xl-init(), so
    xlator_destroy() works smoothly.

    stripe readv_cbk: Fix stat return values
    
    Workaround -
    If the read request, does not fall to the subvolume with the largest
    file size set, then we never return the correct size. This leads to
    clients seeing a truncated file error.
    
    The work around is to wipe stat being returned as part of read call.
    
    Problem -
    We were passing the stbuf returned by the first child/index, which
    can be different to the size/blocks returned by stat. This led to
    applications viewing the file as being truncated.

    cluster/afr : Fix self-heal of special files
    
    Fixes self-heal of special files like device files, fifo files, socket files
    etc. Does it by doing the following:
    * Prevent setting of pending data xattr on a special file during entry self-heal
      when a new fils is created.
    * Allow data self-heal to be started on all file types other than directories.
      During data self-heal, for special files just erase pending xattrs, if those
      xattrs were set by previous releases of glusterfs.

    fuse: flip xattr key from user to trusted namespace for certain

    This is needed for gsyncd/hadoop-plugin running as non-super

    namespace. Request for a key is made under 'user.' namespace
    and is flipped by fuse xlator for specific xattr name to the
    corresponding 'trusted.' extended attribute.
    
    Both applications set a identifier (client-pid) while doing a
    FUSE mount, which is checked by get/set/remove interfaces in

    changing of the volume types after volume is created.
    
    with this patch, one can do all the below operations:
    
    on a simple distribute volume 'test' with bricks A,B, add bricks C and D:
    
     bash# gluster volume add-brick test replica 2 C D
    
    now the volume 'test' becomes distribute-replicate, with pairs A-C, B-D.
    same holds good for stripe.
    
    and now, one can change the replica count 2 on volume 'test' to 4 like below:
    
     bash# gluster volume add-brick test replica 4 E F G H
    
    now, volume has 'replica' count 4, with pairs being 'A-C-E-F' and 'B-D-G-H'.
    
    after this, if user wants to reduce the replica count, he can do
    
     bash# gluster volume remove-brick test replica 3 C H # (one from each pair)
    
    This should work to reduce the replica count

    locks: perform inode_ref of pl_update_refkeeper outside locked region
    
    Performing inode_ref inside the critical section of pl_update_refkeeper
    (around pl_inode_t->mutex) causes a deadlock with inode_table_t->lock.
    The other thread (process state dump) holds the inode_table_t->lock first
    to loop over inodes and then while dumping an inode's lock context, tries
    to acquire pl_inode_t->mutex thereby completing the deadlock.
    
    The fix is to perform inode_ref outside the critical section in
    pl_update_refkeeper

    glusterd: take off 'auto-commit' behavior of decommissioning
    
    currently if 'remove-brick <BRICKS> start' is given, after all
    the data is migrated, in the _cbk() function from rebalance
    complete we used to re-write the volume file without the bricks.
    But the flaw of this method is that, currently the _cbk() function
    is called on only the node on which rebalance actually happens,
    hence other nodes are not aware of this behavior. So, had to remove
    the 'auto-commit', instead we want the user to issue a command
    'remove-brick <Bricks> commit' (or 'force') explicitely to remove
    the bricks

    glusterd: cleanup unneeded volumes after peer detach
    
    Performs cleanup on the detached peer and in the cluster after a
    peer detach, and also adds a new check before starting detach.
    
    Cleanup -
     On the detached peer, cleanup removes the entries of those volumes
    on the peer that do not have all their bricks on it. This prevents
    these stale volumes from being added to a new cluster when peer is
    attached to one.
     In the cluster, all those volumes which have all their bricks on the
    detached peer are removed.
    
    Checks-
     Checks if all the peers in the cluster are online and connected,
     except the peer being detached, before starting detach. Using force
     will bypass this check and do detach.

    Used a #pragma to kill ~170 in rpcgen code.  Added GF_UNUSED to deal with

    be harder to fix without real understanding of the code where they occur,

    cli : new volume statedump command
    
    Changes:
            1. Add a new 'volume statedump' command, that performs statedumps of
            all the bricks in the volume and saves them in a specified location.
            2. Add new server option 'server.statedump-path'.
            3. Remove multiple function definitions in glusterd.h
    
    Statedump Information:
    
    The 'volume statedump' command performs statedumps on all the bricks in
    a given volume. The syntax of the command is,
            gluster volume statedump <VOLNAME> [type]......
    
    Types include,
            * all
            * mem
            * iobuf
            * callpool
            * priv
            * fd
            * inode
    Defaults to 'all' when no type is specified.
    
    The statedump files are created by default in /tmp directory of the
    server on which the bricks are present.
    This path can be changed by setting the 'server.statedump-path' option.
    
    The statedump files will be named as,
            <brick-name>.<pid of brick process>.dump

    cluster/distribute: fixed a spurious inode ref
    
    While bringing in support to open-fd migration, dht_local_init()
    itself started doing 'loc_copy()'. I had left one case in dht_lookup()
    where there is a extra loc_copy() on existing copied 'local->loc',

    inode_unref() happens in dht_local_wipe().

    rpc: fix wrong wiping of state machine's state
    
    The macro __socket_proto_read() is used to read one sub-header in a fragment
    after another. It also has to 'get out' of the state machine's
    switch/case construct in two situations -
    
    a) finished reading the full header
    
    b) after a partial read, (and return in the same state at next pollin)
    
    The 'reset' of the state should happen only after a full read of the header
    and not if there was a partial read of the header.

    value from the volume info. 'sub_count' is preserved as is for backward

    rpc: No timeouts for lock fops.
    
    As of today, all fops bail out after 30 mins by default. This is not desirable
    with lock fops since it could be 'rightfully blocked' for a really long time.
    But the client would assume that the lock fop has 'expired' after 30 mins and
    clean up its references to the locks.  Later when the locks xlator decides to
    grant it, we are left with an orphan (stale) lock .
    
    This fix exempts lock fops from timeouts. Only on network disruptions both
    client and server decide to 'clean up' the locks held.

    - for IP addess matching, bring in ipaddr module from Google
      (http://code.google.com/p/ipaddr-py/, rev. trunk@225)
    
    This will let users control master's access to slave's volumes
    until we implement unprivileged geo-rep (delayed due to some
    technical issues). It's also needed for the completeness of
    our hardening efforts, as plain file slaves won't be able

    gsyncd: implement restricted mode and utility dispatch
    
    With this change, the suggested way of setting up a geo-sync
    slave is to use an ssh key with gsyncd as a forced command
    (see sshd(8)), or set gsyncd as shell. This prevents the master
    in executing arbitrary commands on slave (a major security hole).
    
    Detailed list the changes:
    - All gsyncd invocations that are not done by glusterd are
      considered unsafe and then we operate in so-called "restricted mode"
      (see below)
    - if we are invoked on purpose (ie. it's not the case that sshd forced
      us to run as frontend of a remote-invoked command), we execute gsyncd.py
    - if invoked by sshd as frontend command, we check the remote command
      line and call the required utility if it's among the allowed ones
      (rsyncd and gsyncd)
    - with rsync, we check if invocation is server mode and some other
      sanity measures
    - with gsyncd, in restricted mode we enforce the usage of the glusterd
      provided config file, and in python, we enforce operation in
      server mode and some other sanity checks
    
    Impact on using geo-rep the old way: remote file slave now also
    requires a running glusterd (to pick up config from).
    
    Missing: we not implemented check of the rsync target path.
    The issue of master being able to modify arbitrary locations
    is planned to be mitigated by using geo-rep with an unprivileged
    user.

    geo-rep: rewrite gsyncd wrapper in C
    
    This rewrite does not change functionality;
    it's purpose is to prepare followup modifications which will let
    all slave side helper programs being dispatched to through
    gsyncd. The string processing that's required for that task would
    be too much cumbersome in shell.

    Peer probe: Handle probe of friend with multiple hostname
    
    Currently, when a peer is probed with a different hostname already belonging
    to a cluster, a duplicate entry is created with uuid to set to 0.
    This leaves the peerinfo in a inconsistent state, and when a detach of
    this peer is issued, the correct entry gets removed.
    
    The fix is to identify a peer with a hostname not matching to the probed
    hostname and remove the incorrect entry.

    * mempool: more details added (with a name to tell why mem-pool

    * As RPC program's name is just used for logging, we now have
      'PACKAGE_VERSION' part of the string, which gets logged in client
      side.
    * From client, we send the PACKAGE_VERSION in handshake dictionary,
      which gets logged on serverside handshake.
    
    The change doesn't break any compatibility between client or server
    as it would only enhance the logging part of handshake.

    cluster/afr: Make local->child_up immutable
    
    Afr transaction performs lock, pre-op, op, post-op and unlock steps in that
    order. The child_up[] is overloaded with the information of where all
    the first two steps succeeded. This works perfectly fine for
    Transaction, but the locking/unlocking part of the code is re-used by
    data self-heal. In that each loop_frame does lock, rchecksum,
    read-from-source and write-to-sinks, unlock steps.
    
    Rchecksum fop assumes that the fop needs to happen on one source + all
    sinks and sets the call_count to that number. But if the lock step fails
    on any of the sinks it will mark the child_up of that child to 0, which
    will result in call_count mismatch and the frame will hang thinking that
    some more cbks need to come. When this happens loop_frame will never go
    to unlock step leading to hangs on that file.

    glusterfsd: enable max fetch attempts
    
    Enables usage of 'volfile-max-fetch-attempts' option of glusterfsd.
    Also, adds an option to 'mount.glusterfs' for setting the max fetch attempts.
    For a server with multiple ips, each call to gf_resolve_ip6() returns a
    different ip. Since gf_resolve_ip6() is called for each fetch attempt,
    this change also enables rrdns support for gluster.

    libglusterfs: run: fix closing of redirection fd in child
    
    When run was doing a program invocation like "echo foo > foof",
    the file descriptor to foof was closed before stdout could be
    reopened to it.
    
    To fix this, we change the order of actions: first do redirections,
    then do the fd cleanup. This also simplifies code (as there are less
    fds which are exempt of the cleanup).

    support for de-commissioning a node using 'remove-brick'
    
    to achieve this, we now create volume-file with
    'decommissioned-nodes' option in distribute volume, then just
    perform the rebalance set of operations (with 'force' flag set).
    
    now onwards, the 'remove-brick' (with 'start' option) operation tries
    to migrate data from removed bricks to existing bricks.
    
    'remove-brick' also supports similar options as of replace-brick.
    
    * (no options) -> works as 'force', will have the current behavior
             of remove-brick, ie., no data-migration, volume changes.
    
    * start  (starts remove-brick with data-migration/draining process,
              which takes care of migrating data and once complete, will
              commit the changes to volume file)
    * pause  (stop data migration, but keep the volume file intact with
              extra options whatever is set)
    * abort  (stop data-migration, and fall back to old configuration)
    * commit (if volume is stopped, commits the changes to volumefile)
    * force  (stops the data-migration and commits the changes to
              volume file)

    distribute rebalance: handle the open file migration
    
    Complexity involved: To migrate a file with open fd, we have to
    notify the other client process which has the open fd, and make
    sure the write()s happening on that fd is properly synced to the
    migrated file. Once the migration is complete, the client
    process which has open-fd should get notified and it should
    start performing all the operations on the new subvolume,
    instead of earlier cached volume.
    
    How to solve the notification part:
    
    We can overload the 'postbuf' attribute in the _cbk() function to
    understand if a file is 'under-migration' or 'migration-complete'
    state. (This will be something similar to deciding whether a file
    is DHT-linkfile by its 'mode').
    
    Overall change includes below mentioned major changes:
    
    1. dht_linkfile is decided by only 2 factors (mode(01000),
       xattr(trusted.glusterfs.dht.linkto)), instead of earlier
       3 factors (size==0)
    
    2. in linkfile self-heal part (in 'dht_lookup_everywhere_cbk()'),
       don't delete a linkfile if there is a open-fd on it. It means,
       there may be a migration in progress.
    
    3. if a file's revalidate fails with ENOENT, it may be due to file
       migration, and hence need a lookup_everywhere()
    
    4. There will be 2 phases of file-migration.
    
    -> Phase 1: Migration in progress
       * The source data file will have SGID and STICKY bit set in its mode.
       * The source data file will have a 'linkto' xattr pointing the
         destination.
       * Destination file will have mode set to '01000', and 'linkto' xattr
         set to itself.
    
    -> Phase 2: File migration Complete
       * The source data file will have mode '01000', and will be 'truncated'
         to size 0.
       * The destination file will have inherited mode from the source. (without
         sgid and sticky bit) and its 'linkto' attribute will be removed.
    
    4. Changes in distribute to work smoothly with a file which is in migration /
       got migrated.
    
    The 'fops' are divided into 3 categories, inode-read, inode-write and others.
    inode-read fops need to handle only 'phase 2' notification, where as, the
    inode-write fops need to handle both 'phase 1' and phase2. The inode-write
    operations will be done on source file, and if any of 'file-migration' procedures
    are detected in _cbk(), then the operations should be performed on the destination
    too.
    
    when a phase-2 is detected, then the inode-ctx itself should be changed to represent
    a new layout.
    
    With these changes, the open file migration will work smoothly with multiple clients.

    geo-rep: partial support for unprivileged gsyncd via mountbroker
    
    gsyncd:
      - mounting code is split to a direct and a mountbroker based backend
      - option gluster-command gone
      - new options: gluster-params, gluster-cli-options, mountbroker
      - mountbroker mount backend is used if either a mountbroker label
        is given through the mountbroker option, or if gsyncd is
        unprivileged; in this case the username is used as label
      - have gluster cli invocations log to stderr so that we don't
        hit a permission issue with the logfiles
    glusterd:
      - do gsyncd pre-config with new options
      - add option geo-replication-log-group, so if that specified
        geo-rep logfile directories are given to that group (and
        thus members of the given group can do logging there)
    
    This is just WIP as geo-rep relies on trusted extended attributes
    and those are not accessible for unprivileged users. Even if we
    solved this issue, glusterd security settings are too coarse,
    so that if we made it possible for an unprivileged gsyncd
    to operate, we would open up too far.

    glusterd / cli: mount-broker service
    
    Mountbroker is configured in glusterd volfile through a DSL
    which is restriced enough to be able to appear in the role
    of the value of a volfile knob.
    
    Basically the DSL describes set-theorical requirements
    against the option set which is sent by the cli (in the
    hope of getting a mount with these options).
    
    If the requirements meet and the volume id and the uid
    who is to "own" the mount can be unambigously deduced from
    the given request, glusterd does the mount with the given
    parameters.
    
    The use case of geo-replication is sugared by means of volume
    options which then generate a complete mount-broker option set.
    
    Demo:
    
    - add the following option to your glusterd volfile:
    
        option mountbroker-root /tmp/mbr
        option mountbroker.fool EQL(volfile-id=pop*|user-map-root=*|volfile-server=localhost)&MEET(user-map-root=john|user-map-root=jane)
    
    - before starting glusterd, create /tmp/mbr owned by root with mode 0755
    
    - with cli, do
    
       $ gluster system:: mount fool volfile-id=pop33 user-map-root=jane volfile-server=localhost
    
    - on succesful completion (volume pop33 exists and is started, jane is a valid username),
      the mount path will be echoed to you
    
    - you can get rid of the mount by
    
       $ gluster system:: umount <mount-path>

    cluster/afr: Make data selfheal trigger to be configurable.
    
    By default, lookup triggers data self-heal but that is not the preferred way
    of operating replicated volumes. We would like the data self heals to be
    triggered in open instead.
    Number of back-ground self-heals allowed is 16 and lookups block until
    self-heal is completed. We want to prevent blocking in fops. We can not make
    lookups independent of self-heal frames because when there are gfid conflicts
    the decision of which file is correct is determined in self-heal phase.
    So in afr, lookup self-heal is going to guarantee name space consistency
    and open/fd fops will take responsibility for data consistency, these
    are non blocking. The user needs to set the option cluster.data-self-heal
    "open" for this behavior.

    cluster/afr: eager locking of FD writes
    
    This patch is a change in the way write transactions hold a lock
    which optimizes the case of sequential writes from a single writer.
    
    Lock phase of a transaction has two sub-phases. First is an attempt
    to acquire locks in parallel by broadcasting non-blocking lock
    requests. If lock aquistion fails on any server, then the held locks
    are unlocked and revert to a blocking locked mode sequentially on
    one server after another.
    
    The change in this patch is to make the initial broadcasting lock
    request attempt to acquire lock on the entire file. If this fails,
    we revert back to the sequential "regional" blocking lock as before.
    
    In the case where such an "eager" lock is granted in the non-blocking
    phase, it gives rise to an opportunity for optimization. i.e, if
    the next write transaction on the same FD arrives before the unlock
    phase of the first transaction, it "takes over" the full file lock.
    Similarly if yet another transaction arrives before the unlock phase
    of the "optimized" transaction, that in turn "takes over" the lock
    as well. The actual unlock now happens at the end of the last
    "optimzed" transaction.
    
    Any operation which arrives before the unlock phase of the previous
    transaction is a potential candidate to become an "optimized"
    transaction. In cases where the previous transaction had aquired
    lock as a "regional" blocking lock, and the next transaction comes
    in before its unlock phase, then it would not be an "optimized"
    transaction.
    
    Implied assumption
    ------------------
    
    Since two or more transactions can now operate within the same
    large lock, there is a possibility that overlapping transactions
    can arrive at oppoosite orders on the servers. However in the
    larger picture this is not possible as write-behind already
    ensures that no two overlapping writes on an inode are in transit
    at the same time. Overlapping writes across clients are not a
    problem as they compete at locks anyways.
    
    Theoretical benefits and potential harms
    ----------------------------------------
    
    In case of a single writer: The benefits are large for sequential
    writes. In the best case the entire file write can happen with just
    one lock and unlock per server, provided writes are coming in fast
    enough and getting pipelined by write-behind soon enough (which is
    usually the case). If the writes are not coming in fast enough, then
    the optimization "kicks in" for only those subsets of writes which
    are close enough to get "piggybacked". For random writes the benefits
    are the same as well. In any case the overall performance is better
    than or equal to the performance without this optimization for a single
    writer.
    
    In case of multiple writers: When multiple writers are not writing
    concurrently, there is no negative performance impact. When multiple
    writers are writing concurrently to the same region, there is no
    negative impact either, as they were previously getting arbitrated
    at the locks translator too. In the case of multiple writers writing
    to different regions concurrently, there will be an increased number
    of "failovers" from failed parallel non-blocking to sequential blocking
    regional locks. This above "worst case" has a simple workaround that
    as soon as we detect > 1 open-fd-count in lookup xattr, we can disable
    this optimization on those fds.
    
    Beneficial side-effects
    -----------------------
    
    There is another similar optimization in AFR for changelogs which goes
    by the name of "changelog-piggybacking". That works in a similar way where
    pending flags get 'taken over' or 'piggybacked' by the next transaction
    if its 'pre-op' phase kicks in before the 'post-op' phase of the
    previous transaction. It has been observed that this changelog-piggybacking
    optimization gives a saving of about ~55% savings of xattr calls hitting
    the wire, measured across various types of network interfaces. The side
    effect of this eager-lock optimization is that it gives an almost 100%
    saving of xattr calls by making the optimistic-changelog work much more
    efficiently as it gives a wider overlap of the xattr phases of two
    consecutive transactions.

    nfs3: Resolve entry vs. hash conflict at same dir depth
    
    Intro Note
    ==========
    The current code in hard fh resolution takes the first-match approach, i.e.
    which ever dirent either matches the hash or matches the gfid first
    is the one chosen as the result for the next step of fh resolution. In
    the latter case, i.e., dirent matches the gfid, we the next step is to
    conclude the fh resolution by returning the entry whose gfid matched.
    In the former, i.e., the hash matches the dirent, we choose the hash-matching
    dirent as the next directory to descend into, for searching the file to be
    operated upon.
    
    Problem
    =======
    When performing hard fh resolution, there can be a situation where:
    
    o the hash of the primary entry,i.e. the entry we're looking for and the hash
    of another sibling directory, match. Note the use of "sibling", meaning both
    the primary entry and the hash matching one are in the same directory, i.e.,
    their filehandle.hashcount will be same.
    
    o the sibling directory is encountered first during the dir search.
    
    Because of the current code described in "Intro", we'll end up descending into
    the sibling directory even though the correct behaviour is to ignore this and
    wait till we encounter the primary entry in the same parent directory.
    
    Once we end up descending into this sibling directory, the directory depth
    validation check fails. The check fails because it notices that the resolution
    is attempting to open a directory that is deeper in the fs tree than the file
    we're looking for. When this check fails, we return an ESTALE. So basically, a
    false-positive results in an estale to Specsfs.
    
    This is not a theoretical situation. Me and Avati saw this on specsfs test
    where sfs created terabytes-sized file system for its tests. The number of
    files was so huge in a single directory that the hashes of two entries ended up
    colliding.

    step 3: check diff with the to the existing files, add only your part
            of changes back to the original file. (ignore other changes).
    step 4: there is another file to write wrapper functions to convert
            structures to/from XDR buffers, update it with your new structure.
    step 5: use these wrapper functions in the newly written procedures.
    step 6: commit :-|
    
    Now:
    step 1: update (mostly adding only) the <xdr>.x file
    step 2: run '<path-to-src>/extras/generate-xdr-files.sh <xdr>.x' command
    step 3: implement rpc procedure to handle the request/response.

    cluster/afr: Prevent double big lock when data self-heal loops are not spawned
    
    The steps in normal data self heal:
    1) take big lock by self-heal frame. Get the xattrs/stat to decide
    source, sink information.
    2) spawn loop frames which perform self-heal by taking small locks on
    the file. Every time a new lock is taken and the old lock is released.
    3) Before releasing the final small lock a big lock is taken by the
    self-heal frame, and unlock on small-lock. Erasing of the pending xattrs
    happen then the big unlock happen and that is the end of the data self-heal.
    
    When a data self-heal is needed for a file and the fop
    that triggers the self-heal is open with O_TRUNC. Fuse sends open then
    an explicit truncate for this. Open triggers the self-heal but by the
    time it tries to spawn the loops the file size is truncated to 0, so
    no loops are formed.
    These are the steps:
    1) Take big lock by self-heal frame. Get the xattrs/stat to decide
    source, sink information.
    2) loop frames are not spawned. The big lock is not released.
    3) One more big lock is taken by the same self-heal frame, Erasing of
    the pending xattrs etc happen, now it does two big unlocks, but after
    the first unlock, the information on which the locks were performed is
    forgotten, so the next unlock becomes a no-op. So there is a stale big
    lock on that file preventing further writes.
    
    As a fix, if the loops are not spawned, use the previous big lock to
    perform the rest of the operations needed in completing the data
    self-heal. No need to have one more big lock.

    posix-acl: disable permission checks for fd based ops
    
    If write calls are coming in through an fd with O_RDWR or O_WRONLY
    flag then a permission check is unnecessary. However writes from
    NFS ideally need a "stateless" check in each call and this results
    in a permission failure due to the read-only mode (disregarding the
    FD's writeability).
    
    For now it is acceptable to disable write checks as almost always
    the NFS client would already be doing such basic access control.
    Also because the previous access-control translator (prior to
    posix ACL introduction) too was permitting writes and reads
    unconditionally.
    
    In fact the Linux KNFS server too assumes the NFS client would have
    done the permission check.

    fuse-resolve: prevent linking of inodes of different inode-table
    
    This can happen in deep_resolve_cbk, which happens after a graph
    switch. Root cause was because the graph change happened while
    a FOP was in transit and by the time the call came back, the active
    translator of fuse is now changed.
    
    Fix is to make sure the resolve operation happens on a given
    inode table, instead of taking the latest graph of fuse for
    each operation

    Replace mktemp(3) with mkstemp(3).
    
    Man page states:
    Some implementations follow 4.3BSD and replace XXXXXX by the current process ID
    and a single letter, so that at most 26 different names can be returned.  Since
    on the one hand the names are easy to guess, and on the other hand there is a
    race between testing whether the name exists and opening the file, every use of
    mktemp() is a security risk. The race is avoided by mkstemp(3).

    Provides an upstart job for glusterd on Ubuntu, solving Bug 3282
    
    Mounting from localhost in fstab fails at boot on ubuntu when glusterd is started by debian initscript.
    
    A new directory, extras/Ubuntu, contains the new upstart job (glusterd.conf) and a brief README.Ubuntu file.
    This makes the upstart job available to package maintainers like the SysV initscripts are in extras/init.d.
    
    This has been tested on Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick.

    performance/quick-read: Handle unwinding of frame corresponding to read fop properly, while validating cache.
    
      - there was a possibility of double unwind in case of errors.
      - use a new frame to do open in fd-based fops.
        In case of errors, qr_resume_pending_ops will be called to resume all the
        fops waiting on open. Hence if we use frame corresponding to fop (without
        creating a new one), there is a possibility of frame being freed by the
        time open would've returned to quick-read.

    Stripe_readdirp: Fix race in wind/unwind which led to crash
    
    Scenario - The race window exists when before we wind to a stat call
    in readdirp_cbk, whereas stats have returned to cbk. We would free up
    local, which leads to a crash.
    
    Fix - We assume all entries to be regular files, and set the wind_count
    as a multiple of entries * subvol (stat calls). When we encounter a non
    regular file, we decrement the windcount accordingly (subvol times). If
    the last entry happens to be a non-regular file, and all stat calls have
    wound back, we unwind from here itself.

    rpc-transport/socket: avoid logging socket read fails
    
    An option, transport.socket.read-fail-log was added in glusterd.
    This can also be added to any translator which uses socket.c.
    A gf_boolean_t flag(read_fail_log) is added in socket_private_t.
    Using this, logging of socket read failures can be controlled.
    The options is set to 'off' in glusterd.vol by default.

    gerrit: some fixes for the rfc script
    
    In rebase_changes():
    
    - Using "--all" for git fetch is bogus: the scope of this quantification is not
      over the tracked refs of the upsteam repo (which we do want, but that kind
      of universal quantification is already implied by the notion of "tracking"),
      but over the set of all the registered remotes, which is an annoying side effect.
    
    - $EDITOR is weaker than the git configuration settings. For the purpose of the
      script, we need to override any kind of setting, and that can be done
      via $GIT_EDITOR.
    
    Cf. git-fetch(1), git-commit(1).

    posix: perform readdir filling in locked region
    
    When two application threads share an open dir fd (DIR *) and issue
    readdirs, storage/posix will receive separate readdir fops in separate
    threads in parallel. This has two-fold issues
    
    1. In the following pair of operations -
    
       entry = readdir(dir)
           and
       strcpy (gf_dirent->name, entry->d_name)
    
       @entry is a static buffer in libc which can get reused by another thread
       to get filled with a longer name. This can cause the second operation
       to overflow the buffer as the allocation was for the smaller name.
    
    2. In the following pair of operations -
    
       seekdir (dir, offset)
          and
       entry = readdir(dir)
    
       If two threads are executing these sequence in parallel in separate
       threads, then one of them will end up reading wrong/unexpected entries.
    
    It would be sufficient to fix 1. by using readdir_r but that still keeps
    the second race open. Hence the patch moves all the set of operations to a
    locked region which solves both races.

    server: Reassociating 'old' conn can lead to chaos.
    
    Since we moved to a single socket connection b/w client and server,
    inherting connection state is unnecessary and can sometimes be
    dangerous when clients reconnect even before the server detects
    a socket error on the old connection.
    
    Dirty detail: This reassociation results in 'ref count' not decreasing
    in tandem with the connection disconnects. This results in a resource
    leak.

    distribute: handle 'fix.layout' key in setxattr() instead of getxattr()
    
    as 'fix.layout' command does changes to directory layout, its not a

    setxattr() better

    PUMP: perform opendir on pump xlator instead of its child
    
    When replace-brick is performed, there is a high probability for the
    directories on the source brick to not have any pending entry xattrs.
    So for proper self-heal we need the force merge to kick in.
    If the opendir is performed on pump xlator directory is examined and
    if the entries on its children do not match then force merge is
    triggered, so missing entries will be created on the sink.
    Pending xattrs are set from source to sink on the files present on
    source in this process. So when the lookup happens the self-heal
    is triggered.
    
         Before this fix, the code is working because the self-heal source is
    decided based on what file is biggest in size which is a wrong and
    removed.

    pump: cleanup xattrs on both commit and abort path.
    
    This change makes glusterd to send a setxattr command
    for replace-brick commit operation similar to abort.
    
    Earlier we could commit even before the 'migration'
    of data was complete, with this change we fail that
    operation.

    Earlier syncops used to accept one argument which
    was a call frame to carry out the fops synchronously.
    Now we have two args passed to synctask function, one
    call frame and another void pointer.

    quick-read: Fix dirname(3) usage
    
    glibc dirname() modify the string it is given and returns it.
    glusterfs takes this behavior for granted, and assume that if it
    gives a malloc'ed string to dirname(), then it can free()) the
    return value.
    
    Here is what SUSv2 says:
    http://opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/dirname.html
    "The dirname() function may modify the string pointed to by path,
    and may return a pointer to static storage"
    
    At least NetBSD returns a static storage. glusterfs will return it to
    a calling function that has the responsability to free it, causing
    a SIGSEGV.

    fuse: NetBSD portability fixes
    
    - NetBSD uses libperfuse(3).
    - Add @GF_FUSE_LDADD@ to fuse.so library dependecies so that -lperfuse is
      added at configure time for NetBSD.

    rpc: use AI_ADDRCONFIG selectively
    
    NetBSD does not have AI_ADDRCONFIG. This patch has a side effect: glusterfsd
    listens on IPv6 adresses only by default. Option transport.socket.bind-address
    in volume server-tcp must be used to listen on an IPv4 address.

    libglusterfs: add 'run' sub-lib for safe and convenient invocation of external programs
    
    Summary:
    
    - arguments first collected, then the invocation happens with fork + exec
    - flexible specification of arguments (besides si{mp,ng}le argument
      addition, support for adding multiple of them at a time / specifying one with
      printf style formatting) [ ==> goodbye printf percentage soup when composing
      commands ]
    - single point of error check
    - simple command runs are done in just one line
    - support for redirection, popen(3) like functionality
    
    API is documented in details in libglusterfs/src/run.h

    upon daemonizing, wait on mtab update to terminate in parent
    
    This fixes the race in between the mtab update attempts of mount and umount
    when we do a lazy umount right after mounting, in order to hide the given fs
    instance; yet this way we still avoid the deadlock of the fs and mount which
    we can hit if we wait unconditionally for the mtab update to terminate (cf.
    bz #511).

    Introduce client-allow-insecure xlator-option.
    
    Allows glusterfs clients to bind to any port and does not restrict it
    to 1024.
    
    This is a xlator-option only, and is not supported in volume set cmd.
    The reason is, few clients may choose this, and few may not. Hence
    only supported as a xlator-option during mount time.
    
    For this to work with glusterfs, server.allow-insecure should be set
    to on

    cli: taking my revenge for forcing "geo-replication" into commandline
    
    Accept unambigous initial fragments of keywords, eg.
    
      gluster vol geo stat
    
    is recognized. Compared to readline integration:
    
    - no external dependency
    - works in shell too
    - works for inner keywords of operations
      (as in above example, or "vol crea <vol> repl 3 ...")
    - you save pressing tabs :)
    
    If not desired in customer builds, can be disabled by an #ifdef
    (not integrated into build system as of now); however, I think

    performance/write-behind: initialize lock in wb-file before wb-file is set in fd-ctx.
    
    - Consider a combination of fuse->quick-read->read-ahead->wb->client.
        quick-read can do open-behind (open is returned as success even
        before it is issued to backend) and hence the fd can already be
        in the list of open fds of the inode. A flush call on some other
        fd opened on the same inode, will result in ra_flush issuing flush
        calls to all the fds opened on the same inode. This can result in
        wb_flush trying to hold a lock on non-initialized lock there by causing
        memory corruption.

    glusterd / geo-rep: harvesting further benefits of static gsyncd pre-config
    
    - log-file does not need to be a reserved option anymore as we
      wouldn't overwrite the user setting
    - reimplement glusterd_gsync_get_param_file(): all use cases
      have now pre-configured values, so instead of putting together
      the needed pathname by ourselves, we can just get it from
      gsyncd config
      - refactor it to a common backend with glusterd_get_canon_url()

    glusterd / geo-rep: do all gsyncd pre-configuration in glusterd init
    
    This is made possible by gsyncd config templating, by which
    session specific settings can be expressed in a generic form.
    
    Benefits:
    - in glusterd we use only generic (rx pattern based) config settings
      so we don't violate users' freedom to make settigs for their sessions
    - don't have to invoke gsyncd in excess to prepare a session
    - we can pre-configure slave side too (relying on the templates and
      gsyncd service auto-discovery)
    - much leaner, much more expressive code

    syncdaemon: implement template substitutions for config values
    
    So, for example, a log file setting of
    
      /var/log/${mastervol}/${eSlave}.log
    
    will be substituted with the volume name of the master and the
    canonicalized-escaped name of the slave for each master-slave pair.
    
    As template expanders, beyond the various forms and derivatives
    of master and slave, the following are also available:
     - gsyncd tunables (set in command line or in config)
     - for regexp sections, regexp group captures can be accessed
       via "match<i>_<n>", where i=1,2 corresponds to the i-th peer-rx
       in the section title and n=1,... to the n-th capture.
    
    This will enable us to have a static configuration (not having to
    add new entries on each gsyncd start).

    features/marker-quota: reduce contributions to parents during unlink only if it is the last link.
    
    - since we are not having different contributions for different (parent, name)
        pairs, but only for different parents, links present in the same directory
        will have only one contribution representing all of them. Hence parents will
        not be updated for each link call and parents account for just file-size
        instead of (numlinks * filesize). However this patch will cause issues
        for links present accross directories, as only one of their contributions
        is subtracted when all of them removed (Here all the links are accounted
        in their parents, thereby total size accounted is [numlinks * filesize]).

    DHT: Propogate error if dht_rmdir_opendir_cbk
    
    Earlier rmdir would succeed on all up subvols, but fuse would get an
    error if one of the subvol was down. In follow up lookup, self heal
    would be triggered, and since st_mode would be 0, the permissions
    would be bad. The behaviour now is to fail rmdir if subvol is down

    - use macros for exported volume tunables
    - introduce glusterd_volinfo_get_boolean as retrieval of boolean
      optuions was a recurring pattern and became somewhat cumbersome
    
    Also fixed illegal access to volinfo dict.
    @pranith: use always the glusterd_volinfo_get* API for that purpose
    so that defaults are taken to consideration.

    In afr_private_t structure favorite child is declared as unsigned int.
    In init function of afr we set favorite child to -1, if that option is
    not found in volfile. But favorite child value will be set to a huge
    value instead of -1 since it is an unsigned int and in statedump file
    favorite child value is displayed as a huge value instead of -1.

    syncdaemon: fix setting None as new master
    
    We checked for the event of a new master being adopted by:
    - checking for state change in list of masters
    - checking if our chosen master is a foreign one
    and if these held, then wrote out the actually available master to config
    
    However this was flaky: if
    (1) native master changed
    (2) there was already a foreign master adopted
    (3) actually the master was not available
    then we wrote out the None to config.
    
    This could occur if:
    - on syncd startup, native master just changes from None to the volume native
      [implies (1)]
    - foreign master adopted from earlier run via config [implies (2)]
    - actually foreign master was not available [implies (3)]

    features/quota: Fix race-condition while resuming stub.
    
    - call-stub is resumed in fops calling quota_check_limit and quota_check_limit
        when validate_count is zero, indicating no pending validates. During
        validates, validate_count was decremented in quota_validate_cbk, but check
        for validate_count being zero was done in quota_check_limit (which is
        called by quota_validate_cbk). Hence there is a time window b/w decrementing
        validate_count in quota_validate_cbk and checking whether
        validate_count is zero in quota_check_limit, during which if the
        control is passed to code in fop checking for validate_count being zero,
        same stub will be resumed twice - once in fop and once in quota_check_limit.

Date:   Sat Apr 2 19:40:47 2011 +0000

    syncdaemon: give some refactoring to cascading code
    
    - expiry check of foreign volinfo moved back to GLUSTERServer,
      so that under the hood we can removexattr the expired ones;
      a nice side-effect is that we can use the same dict layout
      for foreign and native volinfo (ie., foreign needs no
      timeout field)
    - get_volinfo() is renamed to get_sys_volinfo() and most of the logic
      is stripped off of it (what remained there is the check
      against foreign master ambiguity)
    - volinfo transition logic is cut out to an almost purely functional
      static method (only impurity is the exeption raised upon
      forbidden volinfo change)
    - ping renamed to keep-alive, as something called "ping" is
      not supposed to have payload (yeah, keep-alive is a bit fishy
      on this front too, but could not come up with better...)

    nfs: capture attrs of create request in cs->stbuf for later use
    
    when attrs coming in as part of create request contain modes other
    than mode, they were getting discarded previously and a setattr
    was getting performed on a 0-filled iatt structure. This would
    result in EPERM at the access control translator as non-root users
    cannot chown a file to uid 0.
    
    Not seen with Linux NFS client as it (very likely) relies upon
    auth-unix to set the ownership of the file or sends an explicit
    setattr after the create.

    nfs: Remove redundant and erroneous check for create mode EXCLUSIVE.
    
    nfs3.c/nfs3_create_common:
    
    The if condition checks for create mode being EXCLUSIVE. However, when
    create mode is EXCLUSIVE, this function never gets called (nfs3_create_exclusive is
    called). Also, instead of checking, it actually sets the value of createmode (= instead of ==).

    Prevent deadlock in io-stats list management of top.
    
    Senario: thread t1 has lock on the queue, and waits on the element lock to remove
    it and unref it. Thread t2 has a lock on the element being removed from the queue,
    but waiting on the queue on the list to update it.
    
    The fix is to move list management to outside of the lock. Additonal to this change
    is adding locks to ios_stat_ref

commit 6d8077eb9c7129f4bdb352132e565906568dfb66
Author: Csaba Henk <csaba@gluster.com>
Date:   Thu Mar 17 11:44:25 2011 +0000

    Revert "syncdaemon: make /usr/libexec/gsyncd the default remote gsyncd (incomplete hacky quickfix)"
    
    This reverts commit 8c801cfd05eb533ae64ea9f06e49e632955cf0c0.
    
    The commit in question was just a temporary fix (which violated
    component boundaries).
    
    Since 9043b0f8 we don't rely on this fix.

Author: Raghavendra G <raghavendra@gluster.com>
Date:   Wed Mar 16 09:40:43 2011 +0000

    performance/quick-read: propagate errors during open back to actual fops.
    
    - If open fails and there are any other fops waiting on that open, those fops
        should also unwind with appropriate errors. Before this patch, irrespective
        of success/failure of open, fops waiting on it were stack_wound and since
        fd was invalid, they would fail with EBADFD errors. Due to this
        actual error would've got masked by EBADFD.

commit ebe47d5dae42da18b289e7be44eb67a8157a56b1
Author: Amar Tumballi <amar@gluster.com>
Date:   Wed Mar 16 09:38:21 2011 +0000

    libglusterfs: gf_log_nomem() and other minor updates
    
    log will be done when the memory allocation fails, hence in code,
    no explicit logs required for memory allocation failures.
    
    also, if there are logs before actually doing a log_init(), they will
    be logged in 'stderr'.

        and handling of a send/recv completion on the same qp for some previous

    Solaris xattr support for symlink and special files.
    
    Since glusterfs uses xattr for storing gfid, and xattr support for
    symlinks and special files does not exist in solaris. The work around
    is provided by creating hidden files under export directory on solaris
    hosts only. the hidden files ares maintained in .glusterfs_xattr_inode directory,
    and all xattr ops on symlink and special files are redirected to respective
    inodes.
    
    All dir entries with name starting as .glusterfs (GF_HIDDEN_PATH) will
    not be shown in readdir ops.

    check the op_ret for less than zero in sp_create_cbk since posix can send negative values other than -1
    
    posix can send -ve values other than -1 in create:
    
    op_ret = setgid_override (this, real_path, &gid);
    
            if (op_ret < 0) {
                    goto out;
            }
    
    In stat-prefetch we check op_ret only for -1 which results in function
    proceeding and op_ret may become 0 due to other function calls in
    sp_create_cbk, hence crashes in fuse.

    rpc/rpc-clnt: don't use iobref passed from caller to hold iobufs required for building program and rpc headers.
    
    - clustering translators like replicate assume iobrefs will be used as
        read-only by lower layers and there by use the same iobref while
        winding calls to multiple children. Since iobrefs can hold only limited
        number of iobufs, this limits the number of children these translators
        can have without overflowing iobrefs.

    glusterfs/d -f path failed if the path was not absolute.
    If the BUF argument is NULL, then on solaris the size argument has to be passed.
    On linux, if the size argument passed is 0, then it dynmically allocates a buffer
     of the required size. The fix is to pass PATH_MAX as the size for consistency.

    Signal handling of the python interpreter is a bit messy, so we cannot
    rely on executing a final clause upon termination. Switch over fcntl
    lock based pidfile handling which can provide reliable info about status
    of the process. (Due to aforementioned reason, pidfile as such is not
    guaranteed to be cleaned up, but lock acquisition is a reliable measure.)

    syncdaemon: config revamp #3: implement command line get/set/del interface to configuration
    
    The INI style config file has following type of sections:
    
    - [global]
    - [peers <local>]
    - [peers <local> <remote>]
    
    Option dispatch to sections is derived from command line (ie., [global]
    if no arg given, [peers <local>] with <local> being the only arg,
    [peers <local> <remote>] if <local> and <remote> args are provided).
    So this all happens under the hood, gsyncd users need not to specify
    sections.
    
    New command line options:
    
    - query options:
      --config-get-all
      --config-get OPT
    - modify options:
      --config-set OPT VAL
      --config-del OPT

    protocol/client: decrement reopen fd count in cases of re-open errors
    
    In post-client-handshake client tries to re-open files, dirs, but if those
    files/dirs are already deleted when the brick is down the reopens
    won't even get triggered. In those cases the re-open fd count needs to
    be decremented to make sure the child up is triggered.
    I have also made similar changes in all the error cases of re-open/re-open-dir
    cbks. Lock recovery is already handling all these errors.

    Fuse cant send aux gids. So access-control checks treat
    non-primary-group membership of user as "other". So skip
    access-control checks if the call is from fuse. We added a hack to
    treat all calls with pid set to 1 as calls from nfs. So for calls with pid
    not 1 we skip the access-control checks on all fops.

    o local structures used by nfs for storing fop state
    o local structures used by nfs3 for storing nfs op state
    
    These are all allocated through the mem-pool. The factor is multiplied by
    a multiple that is specific to each data structure. For eg.
    
    define GF_NFS_CONCURRENT_OPS_MULT     15
    define GF_NFS_INODE_LRU_MULT          6000
    
    The first value is used for allocating a mem-pool for storing
    state for each fop or nfs op that is currently being handled. Knowing that linux
    allows at most 128 in-flight requests, this multiple combined with the default
    mem-factor of 15 gives us 225 slots in the mem-pool for the local structures.
    
    Similarly, 6000*15 gives us a space of 90k inodes in the lru.
    
    That means, increasing the common mem-factor will allow increasing the perf
    under some conditions. This patch introduces the mem-factor as a configurable
    option.

    replicate: propagate CHILD_DOWN upwards properly
    
    During initialization if one subvolume returns CHILD_DOWN, then
    do not consider the other subvolume as down if we still haven't

    This causes DHT (on top) to prematurely (and wrongly) send

    nfs3: Fresh inode lookup on failed revalidation
    
    Brings in changes that were earlier introduced in commit:
    f5afcc47f9f00472d6c2b3f48127e02332cd457a
    
    but reverted because the patch was buggy and caused a seg-fault
    due to extra inode_unrefs.
    
    It fixes that extra inode_unref and cleans up the revalidation logic.

    nfs: opendir/closedir for every readdir
    
    Revert "nfs3: Unref & unbind dir fd with inode lock on EOF"
    
    This reverts commit 4e6fb304ce41acbaf7c9ba67c06bf443e65082e8.
    
    The above commit (which unbinds fds at EOF) does not fix the original
    bug (1619) because a readdir from a second app could have already
    started before the readdir_cbk of the first app's readdir reaches
    NFS code. Hence the race still exists.
    
    Performing extra unrefs when EOF is received is not a reliable way
    of detecting that a client has performed a closedir (and to close
    the fd ourselves). Neither is interpreting a 0 cookies a new opendir.
    Clients can always use telldir/seekdir and hit EOFs twice.
    
    Due to the way NFS3 protocol is designed, it is just not possible
    for the server to reliably detect opendirs/closedirs performed by
    the client and map the corresponding readdirs to the same dir fd
    on the server side.
    
    The only reliable way of fixing this is to perform opendir/closedir
    at the cost of performance. Any optimization towards keeping dir fds
    open attempting to map them with application's opendir/closedir will
    either result in fd leaks or extra fd unrefs.

    replicate: optimistic changelog
    
    The standard way of maintaining changelog in replicate has been to
    write out pending flags and to unset the pending flag post the
    actual operation.
    
    This new optimization kicks in only when all subvolumes are up.
    
    The optimization is that, during pre-op, no changelog is written for
    METADATA and ENTRY/RENAME operations. If during the operation nothing
    failed, no changelog is updated in post-op either. If however,
    something does fail during an operation, then, pending flags get
    written during post op pointing only towards the failed nodes.
    
    DATA transactions continue to work the way they are.
    
    If one subvolume is down, pending flags are written in pre-op changelog
    itself as before.
    
    The impact of this optimization is only in the case when both servers
    die or the client dies while the 'FOP' stage of the transaction is
    in progress. By nature of METADATA and ENTRY operations, detecting a
    mismatch later is not dependent on the presence of changelog. Changelog
    only determines the direction in which self-heal happens for these types
    of transactions. For the direction too this optimization does not have
    a major impact because in the cases of failure (both servers dieing or
    client dieing) the final state (direction of self-heal) would be
    arbitrary anyways as the syscall wouldn't have completed.

    rpc-transport: fix race-condition between rdma-read completion and updating the count of number of vectors to be passed to rpc.
    
    - If rdma read completes before incrementing the vector count, the count
        value sent to rpc will be improper. For fops like write, this may result
        in missing out a vector to be written, thereby causing data corruption.

    With the introduction of variable sized file handle feature in NFS,
    on-wire lengths of file handles can be lesser than file handle structure
    of code. Direct pointer assignment into the offsetted buffer and
    dereference and result in reads beyond the end of buffer and crashes.

    protocol/client: prevent propagation of CHILD_DOWN after pmap query
    
    pmap query results in a new port to which the rpc client reconnects.
    This involves disconnection of current connection to pmap which was
    propagating CHILD_DOWN upwards prematurely

    protocol/server: be consistent in setting rsp.dict_len and rsp.dict
    
    in cases where op_ret was -1 and dict was not NULL, the code was
    setting a dictionary length but not the serialized dictionary. This
    would cause crashes in the xdr serialization function

    rpc-transport/rdma: fix the bug which was causing an ioq-entry being mem_put twice.
    
    - in case of failure to send message, ioq-entry would be freed, but it used to
        get added to the ioq-list. Failure in sending a message (for reasons
        other than insufficient quota), would result in transport being
        disconnected. In the process of handling pollerr, when ioq-list is flushed,
        the same ioq-entry which would've already been freed, would be freed for
        second time.
      - this patch also fixes spurious disconnects happening when quota was not
        available while sending a request.

    protocol/rpc/transport: bring in one more event for 'TRANSPORT-DESTROY'
    
    needed because, a RPC disconnect doesn't mean that a RPC transport/listener
    is dead. With this, the race in server protocol cleaning up the lock table /
    fd table when some frames are in transit will be handled properly.

    volgen: reimplement volgen
    
    Generating a volfile occurs in two steps:
    - Build a graph (ie, glusterfs_graph_t instance) by graph manipulation
      primitives
    - Write out the graph to a file by the the graph printing API.
    
    Graph builder routines can optionally make use of a "modifier dict",
    which can contain overrides wrt. volume options. This can be used
    for a "dry-run" graph generation.

    rebalance: bring in two stages
    
    step 1: fix layout (quick pass, so the newly added brick can
            participate in distribute's entry creations)
    
    step 2: migrate data (do the actual rebalance)
    
    Its advised to run rebalance after add-brick, and let it complete
    at-least 'step 1', so things will be smooth with distribute.

    storage/posix: prevent chmod() from getting called on symlinks
    
    symlinks, if at all their mode can be changed (on non-linux platforms)
    can only be done via lchmod(). Attempting chmod on a symlink can be
    disastrous.

    features/quiesce: new translator
    
    'Quiesce' is used to describe pausing or altering the state of running
     processes on a computer
    
     In GlusterFS context, this translator looks for CHILD_DOWN/CHILD_UP
     events, and will hold the requests for some time if the child node
     is in disconnected state
    
     current timeout is 20seconds, will be made tunable soon

    rpc/rpc-transport: fix frame-loss during rdma-reads.
    
    - total no of rdma reads in progress was tracked using refcount of post
        (refcount = total rdma reads + 1). However doing rdma_post_unref _after_
        rdma_do_reads, can result in race condition between execution of
        rdma_post_unref and procedure handling rdma read completion. This makes
        it impossible to find out whether the current rdma read was the last
        rdma-read being done in procedure handling rdma read-completion.
        The fix to this should either do rdma_post_unref before posting an rdma
        read or use another variable to track the number of rdma-reads.
        This patch implements second method.

    distribute: bring in feature to fix the layout of root inode
    
    * If the errno is ESTALE for root, fuse doesn't send fresh lookup on
      the path (it does for all other inodes). Earlier layout mismatch for
      root never used to happen inside codebase, and if noticed, it was
      serious issue.
    
      Now with DVM, after a add-brick or a remove-brick, layout can be
      changed even for 'root' inode. Needed to fix this issue inside
      distribute itself, instead of fuse sending 'fresh' lookup on root.

    nfs, nfs3: Base volume access on CHILD-UP-DOWN event
    
    Overall, the aim of this patch is to change the result of an nfs
    op depending on whether the underlying volume is up or down
    as notified by CHILD_UP and CHILD_DOWN events.
    
    This patch contains three intertwined changes:
    o Only when the lookup on the root of a volume is successful does gnfs now
    export the subvolume. Till now the result of the lookup was not used to
    determine whether we should export that volume. Not accounting for root lookup
    failure resulted in ESTALEs on first access because some children of distribute
    were down at the time of the root lookup.
    
    o Only when lookups on all the subvolumes have succeeded are
    these exports enabled through NFS.
    
    o When a child of say distribute goes down, on CHILD_DOWN event nfs will
    ignore all incoming requests from the client because ignoring these
    will prevent ESTALEs for those requests and in the hope that ignoring the
    requests will make the client retransmit. There are risks in this approach
    absent the DRC but we're willing to live with that for now.
    When a child goes down, the mount exports list will continue to show it
    but mount requests will be denied.

    libglusterfs: handle failure properly in gf_system()
    
    - Child must be terminated if execve(2) fails, otherwise it will deadlock
      parent
    - Status, as of given by waitpid(2), is aggregated data, should not be
      returned as is. In fact, there is not much point in threading up the
      exitvalue: callers usually return gf_system result as is, and according
      to glusterfs conventions, they should return -1 on failure. Therefore
      now we check only for success/fail, and return 0/-1.

    nfs3: Unref & unbind dir fd with inode lock on EOF
    
    ..so that when EOF is reached on this fd, any further
    requests on the same inode do not get handled through this
    fd but result in a new fd being opened.
    
    Unbinding results in the fd getting deleted from the inode's fd list.

    portmap: add support for registering multiple bricks on one port
    
    Rationale: if a brick serves multiple volumes, all of them need
    to be registered for the port the brick server listens on.
    
    Implementation: to register volumes "foo" and "bar" for port 6543,
    you have to send a SIGNUP for brick: "foo bar", port: 6543.
    Upon a pmap lookup, we match the search term to
    whitespace tokenized bricknames on server side.

    rpc-clnt: fix memory corruption happening while encoding auth data.
    
    - buffer containing authdata pointed by rpc-request was allocated on stack of
       procedure rpc_clnt_fill_request, but was being used as source for xdr-encoding
       in rpc_clnt_record_build_record. Hence by the time auth-data is being copied
       during encoding of request, it might've been freed and hence contain garbage.

       executed multiple times (since sockets are non-blocking), hence wherever

    gfid: introduce uuid based handles for inodes
    
    gfid represents a gluter file id. This is a universally unique id
    assigned to a logical inode, independent of the inode numbers
    assigned by the various backend filesystems to that file/directory.
    The gfid of a file/directory will be the same on servers depending
    on the cluster translator in picture.
    
      The same gfid can be used as a handle across layers of various
    translators and across servers and clients. This was not the case
    previously as the cluster translators would pick the backend inode
    number from one of the servers and convert that into a logical
    inode number by performing some mathematical transforms.
    
      This new technique of addressing inodes also makes dynamic volume
    management have a more robust implementation as the file handles
    remain the same on all versions of the graphs, and allows for
    seamless NFS daemon restarts as well.
    
      This change makes way for server originating communication which
    was not possible earlier as the servers did not have any reliable
    way of addressing client side inodes at all. gfid solves this problem
    by preserving the same uuid as the handle on all the servers and
    across all clients

    fuse: introduce pre-test micro-framework, check for execve-over-direct-IO
    
    The presence of some potential FUSE features in the actual kernel-side FUSE
    implementation we run on is not always straightforward. More precisely, it is
    straightforward only if there is a dedicated feature flag or protocol revision
    number. In the other cases we are left to clumsy and platform specific hacks
    which wire in 3rd-party software revision numbers into our source... at least,
    if we insist on sticking to (the otherwise venerable) KISS principle.
    
    However, here we go for another route, loosely inspired by the way autotools
    provide an abstraction layer for our build system over the gory details of
    platform specific build environments.
    
    At start time, we use a preliminary set of FUSE operations which overlay the
    standard ones such that apart from the "usual stuff", they also present some
    synthetic files to the FUSE client (kernel). Then we spawn some test programs
    which perform the needed tests on these synthetic files to evaulate the FUSE
    implementation in terms of the features in question. According to the result
    of the test programs, we set the respective parameters of the fuse xlator;
    when the testing phase is over, the FUSE operation set is replaced by the
    standard one.
    
    As of now, we use this approach to test whether execve(2) works with
    direct I/O. If yes, and if glusterfs is used with --enable-direct-io-mode,
    then we let direct I/O for files opened for reading; if no, then we restrict
    direct I/O only to writing files.

    nfs3: Unref dir fd once usage ends in hard fh resolution
    
    There are three conditions when a dir fd_t needs to be unrefed
    when:
    
    a. the inode being searched is found as the candidate entry,
    b. we have exhausted all the entries in the current dir,
    c. we decide to step into a child directory because of a hash
    match.
    
    This decision is made in nfs3_fh_resolve_check_response.

    rpcsvc: change in port selection criteria for program to listen on.
    
    - give preference to port specified in options over the port in program
       structure when both are specified. This will enable us to run multiple
       glusterfs server instances on the same machine.

    rpcsvc: check for listener on default port used by mgmt (6969) while registering programs.
    
    - If programs have not provided a default port, rpcsvc tries to allocate a
       listener bound to default port. While registering programs, if programs
       have not given any port information, programs will be associated with
       either default listener or the one provided in options provided during
       rpcsvc_init, with latter given more precedence.

    fuse resolve related changes
    
    Now fuse is fully complaint with DVM, as even if there is a fop
    request on inode belonging to old graph, it will be resolved
    corresponding to new graph and operations will be performed wrt.
    new graph, which makes DVM truely spontaneous.

    rpc: changes to glusterfs programs that can take an optional payload argument.
    
    - The existing interface required the transport to separate the procedure
        header and procedure payload into two different buffers. Making this
        separation can prove cumbersome for transports like rdma wherein the header
        and payload can be received in a single buffer (For eg., header and payload
        of write fop sent as inline msg using rdma-send). This patch delegates the
        responsiblity of separating out header and payload to programs.

    syncop: initial implementation
    
    Resending Avati's syncop patch with a few bug fixes.
    
    (please do not skip the IMPORTANT NOTES section)
    
    * Framework for SYNChronous OPerations
    --------------------------------------
    
    This patch provides a framework for performing synchronous operations
    over the underlying actual asynchronous GlusterFS FOPS.
    
    * Use cases
    -----------
    
    1. Convenient implementation of crawler thread in replicate/pump
    
    2. Convenient implementation of high level control flow in DVM
    
    * Background
    ------------
    
    All (almost) threads in GlusterFS are hosts for executing aysnchronous
    file operations using the STACK_WIND and STACK_UNWIND primitives - as calls
    and callbacks.
    
    While the STACK_WIND and STACK_UNWIND macros provide high control for
    efficiently implementing file operations in a clustered/parallel environment,
    there are tasks where the nature of the task itself is sequential and
    the execution performance of the task is not critical. In these cases the
    complexity to implement the task with STACK_WIND/STACK_UNWIND based operations
    as calls and callbacks is an overkill.
    
    * Introduction
    ---------------
    
    syncop: are wrappers around the STACK_WIND/STACK_UNWIND based asynchronous fops.
    
    synctask: a sequential task (a C function) which uses syncops.
    
    syncenv: an environement to schedule and execute synctasks.
    
    The synchronicity is implemented via ucontext.h based continuations.
    
    Execution of synchronous tasks is possible only in a synchronous environment.
    Therefore, the first step  is to create such an environment -
    
            struct syncenv *env = syncenv_new (0);
    
    This creates a synchronous environment, with a thread (scheduler) to host the
    synchronous tasks. Creation of this environment is generally to be done at the
    time of process initialization. Next is to spawn a synchronous task in this
    environment -
    
            int slow_self_heal (void *data);
            int completion_func (int ret, void *data);
    
            ret = synctask_new (env, slow_self_heal, completion_func, data);
    
    Here slow_self_heal is a task which is implemented using synchronous operations.
    When slow_self_heal() completes, completion_func() is called with the first
    parameter as the return value of slow_self_heal(). Both these functions get
    the @data argument as the same value passed to synctask_new().
    
            int
            slow_self_heal (void *data)
            {
                xlator_t *child = FIRST_CHILD (THIS);
                fd_t     *dir = NULL;
    
                ...
    
                dir = syncop_opendir (child, loc);
                entry = syncop_readdir (dir);
    
                ...
    
                return ret;
            }
    
    * IMPORTANT NOTES
    -----------------
    
    - calling syncops in code executing outside the synchronous environment will
      very likely cause and undesired blocking of the executing thread leading to
      deadlocks!!
      The synchronous environment is a special thread where such sleeps are safe,
      and these sleeps result in the scheduler to 'swap in' other synctasks.
    
    - syncops can put the task to sleep. DO NOT issue syncops while holding mutexes.
      This is very similar to the blunder of holding a mutex and doing STACK_WIND.
    
    - It works best when synctasks use only syncops. If a call_frame is created and
      STACK_WIND'ed, the callback would very likely happen in a thread outside the
      synchronous enviroment, at an undefined time - as expected. So note that the
      synchronous environment does not tame the notorious behaviour of STACK_WIND.

    changes to rpc
    
    - use mem-pool for requests and saved_frames.
      - preserve the rpc_req structure till rpc invokes program's reply.
        This will enable us to store transport specific data that has to
        last till reply has come (eg., memory regions of chunk lists in
        case of rdma).
      - change signature of rpc_clnt_submit to accept rsphdr_vector and
        rsppayload_vector. The buffers pointed by these vectors will be
        from iobufs and these iobufs are added to an iobref which should
        also be passed as an arguement to rpc_clnt_submit.

    nfs3: NULL fdentry check before removing from fdcache
    
    Suppose a file name 1 is created and some data is written to it. After this
    another 512 files are newly created and written to. When the the 513th file is
    created and an fd_t opened for it, it results in 1's fd_t being replaced in the
    fd-lru with 513th file's fd_t. This is the correct behaviour resulting in all
    refs getting unref from the fd_t of 1 and the fd and all related state being
    freed.
    
    But, in some workloads, some refs are still pending even after the fd_t is
    removed from LRU, resulting in the fd still being bound to the inode. In
    nfs3svc_remove_cbk, while removing the inode state, we also ensure that any
    fd_ts in the cache for this inode are also removed. While removing the fd_t,
    this situation where the fd_t has replaced with another, even while a ref
    remains on the fd_t, results in a crash in the fdcache_remove path in
    nfs3svc_remove_cbk. This happens because the fd_ctx_get results in a NULL value
    because the ctx was already deleted when this fd_t was removed from fd-lru
    earlier. This patch fixes the crash by introducing a NULL check.

    replicate: Set setxattr wait-count to child-count to avoid race
    
    A race is seen during a compilebench load against NFS where a NFSv3 MKDIR is
    immediately followed by a LOOKUP on the new directory. By the time this lookup
    comes in, the setxattr issued by distribute for the mkdir has not returned yet
    from all the replicas. Since replicate returns a reply for setxattr after
    receiving reply only from one subvol, the MKDIR is unwound from distribute.
    
    When the LOOKUP is received at distribute, the setxattr has still not completed
    at the second replica, whereas that is where the lookup is sent by replicate.
    Finding that the xattr is missing from the dir, distribute returns ESTALE to
    NFS, which return NFS3ERR_STALE to nfs client.
    
    This patch changes replicate setxattr behaviour by forcing replicate to wait for all
    children rather than one to call back before unwinding the stack.

    proper way to do defrag of a mountpoint
    
    Usage: "glusterfs-defrag <MOUNTPOINT>"
    
    there are new features added to distribute with this patch:
    
    * bash# getfattr -n trusted.distribute.linkinfo <file>
      Gives output in the format "<hostname>:<directory>", if there is a
      linkfile present, where hostname is server, directory is backend
      directory where the actual linkfile is present.
    
    * bash# getfattr -n trusted.glusterfs.pathinfo <path>
      Gives layout information if directory, and info about actual
      location of file in backend servers, in the form of
      'hostname:directory'. (TODO: should extend it to all xlators)
    
    * bash# getfattr -n trusted.distribute.fix.layout <path>
      scales out the directory layout in distribute, so when new
      servers are added, layouts are fixed to include them.
    
    * removed 'scale-n-defrag.sh' as its no more required.
    
    * changed 'defrag.sh' to have a feature to specify target bricks,
      so defrag happens to only those nodes. moved the file to
      'glusterfs-defrag', which now gets installed to '${prefix}/bin'
    
    * storage/posix:
      takes new option 'hostname' so it can resolve to same hostname
      given during 'gluster volume create'.
      with 'trusted.glusterfs.pathinfo' posix returns the value in
      'hostname:real_path' format.

    nfs3: Fix race updating op queue on uncached fd open
    
    The order of locking while performing async fd opens was resulting in

    nfs: Support directory level exports
    
    nfsx has followed traditional approach of exporting whole volumes
    as NFS exports. The Platform requires and some users have approached us for
    introducing exports of only specific directories instead of full Gluster
    volumes. This commit introduces this support through two nfsx options:
    
    Option 1:
    
    =========
    option nfs3.<volume-name>.export-dir <subdir1-in-vol>,<subdir2-in-vol>,..<subdirN-in-vol>
    
    export-dir will allow the export of a particular dir as a single export
    by itself. For eg.:
    
    volume posix
            type storage/posix
            option directory /export/
    end-volume
    
    volume posix-ac
            type features/access-control
            subvolumes posix
    end-volume
    
    volume nfs
            type nfs/server
            subvolumes posix-ac
            option rpc-auth.addr.allow *
            option nfs3.posix-ac.export-dir /homes/shehjart
    end-volume
    
    A comma separate list of sub-directories will set up those dirs as separated exports.
    At the nfs client, the mount command will be:
    
    $ mount <nfsserver>:/posix-ac/homes/shehjart /mnt
    
    Option 2:
    =========
    option nfs3.<volume-name>.export-volumes <on|off>
    
    There can be situations where users only want the directory level
    exports and require that volume exports be completely disabled. The
    above option allows us to do this. By default, volume exports are
    enabled. From the earlier example, replacing <volume-name> with
    posix-ac, will disable mounting of the posix-ac volume as a whole.

    performance/write-behind: explicitly enforce ordering of overlapping writes.
    
    - If there are non-contiguous offsets (offsets which do not start where
        previous write ended), wait for completion of previous writes to server,
        before sending new ones.
      - Send flush call to server only when all writes are completed.
      - If a file is opened with O_APPEND, at any point of time a maximum only one
        write call to server should be in transit. This is to avoid reordering of
        writes in the presence of afr which can result in data corruption.
        See bug #934 for more details.

    nfs3: Special-case the lookup for parent dir of root
    
    When a lookup request comes in for (rootfh, ".."), we need to handle
    it in a way that returns the attributes and handle of the root dir.
    Not doing so crashes nfsx because the inode table is not able to
    find a inode for the root's parent. This inode was being referenced in
    nfs3_lookup_parentdir_resume when filling a loc for the lookup fop.
    
    For the record, such a lookup request is sent by vmkernel.

    In the readdir reply for the root of the export, replace the ino
    and gen number for the . and .. entries with 1 and 0 respectively.
    On clients which inspect this field, the client will error out due
    to the change in inode number of the root directory when see for "."
    
    .. also needs to be replaced because we do not have a concept of
    the parent directory of root. The return of 1 and 0 is the same as
    the behaviour of: stat /.. command.

    performance/write-behind: explicitly enforce ordering of overlapping writes.
    
    - If there are non-contiguous offsets (offsets which do not start where
        previous write ended), wait for completion of previous writes to server
        before sending new ones.
      - Send flush call to server only when all writes are completed.
      - If a file is opened with O_APPEND, at any point of time a maximum only one
        write call to server should be in transit. This is to avoid reordering of
        writes in the presence of afr which can result in data corruption.

    nfs: Introduce trusted-write and trusted-sync options
    
    Introduces two new options:
    
    1. nfs3.*.trusted-write: Forces UNSTABLE writes to return STABLE to NFS
    clients to prevent the clients from sending a COMMIT. STABLE writes
    are still handled in a sync manner and so are COMMITs if they're sent
    at all.
    
    2. nfs3.*.trusted-sync: Forces all WRITEs and COMMITs to return STABLE
    return flags to NFS clients to avoid the overhead of STABLE writes, and
    COMMITs that follow UNSTABLE writes. This includes the trusted-write
    functionality. In addition to the trusted-write, it also writes
    STABLE writes in an UNSTABLE manner.
    
    Both violate the NFS protocol but allow better write perf in most
    configurations. Use with caution.

    nfs3: Round-up read reply bytes of multi-vector reply
    
    A previos commit brought in support for returning read replies
    when subvolumes return reads in multiple iovecs. This did
    not completely fix the problem since the bytes in iovecs
    all together could be unaligned with the 4 byte
    boundary as needed by XDR for the opaque data. This resulted
    in read requests being either retransmitted or rejected with
    an error message in syslog on the NFS client.

    posix: Support thread-safe vectored writes/reads
    
    ..by maintaining internal offsets and using pwrite/pread
    instead of writev/read.
    
    The recent io-threads change is causing concurrent writes to
    a file from different io-threads. This results in a race between
    two threads both of which are trying to call lseek-writev. The
    lseek-writev sequence should be a critical section. This is where
    pwrite syscall helps. pwrite also requires an offset to be given so
    for supporting pwrites for multiple iovecs we maintain an offset
    within posix for the duration of the write fop and pass this internal
    offset to pwrite.
    
    The same logic also applies to read, only difference is that we do
    not need to read multiple iovecs but only provide an atomic
    lseek-read sequence.

    Since the call bail does not occur in the context of an xlator,

    nfs3: Use nfs3state in call_state to avoid getting from rpc request
    
    This change avoids having the nfs translator depend on the sanity
    of the rpcsvc_request_t type after NFS reply has been sent. This
    was a problem because the request structure is guaranteed to be
    invalid after the reply for the request has been submitted by the
    RPC program. NFS3 handler was ignoring this behaviour and accessing
    the private in request after reply submission resulting in access to
    corrupted data.

    nfs3: Allow all access to superuser except execute at all times
    
    During building glusterfs from source, the make phase fails because the
    access test by super user actually returns the access test bits using
    only the user, group and other, without accounting for the special
    status of super-user.
    
    This results in a permission denied for the super-user.

    core: Do internal latency measurement of FOPs.
    
    This patch adds a facility by which each translator
    keeps track of the average latency of a FOP from
    its point of view. That is, the duration between
    the translator handing over the call to a lower-level
    translator and the reply coming back.
    
    The latency measurement is off by default, and can
    be toggled by sending SIGUSR2 to the GlusterFS process.
    
    Latency data is printed as part of the process state dump.

    nfs: Redesign fop argument passing to support single volfile use
    
    The current design of the interaction between the generic NFS layer and the
    protocol handlers like mount3 and nfs3 is such that it does not allow using a
    single volume file which contains the nfs/server and the protocol/server.
    This is because the common nfs-fops layer assumes that ctx->top is always the
    nfs/server. This is wrong. The fops layer needs access to top because top or
    rather the generic NFS xlator's private state has a mem-pool. The fops layer
    needs this mem-pool to get memory for storing per-fop state. Since the fops
    layer cannot anymore take ctx->top be the nfs/server, all layers need to start
    passing the nfs/server xlator_t right down to the fops layer.
    
    I am also taking this chance to remove the synchronous equivalents of the fops
    and also remove the dirent caching directory operations.

    stripe: logic fixes
    
    * for setting 'local->failed'
      Earlier, stripe was not handling different errors from subvolumes,
      and hence failure testcases using 'debug/error-gen' were failing.
      With this fix, tests pass fine.
    
    * proper event handling in notify.
      Send CHILD_UP and CHILD_DOWN events properly.

    A self-heal on directory creation results in the subsequent

    But when this function is called for the last subvol it is possible
    that the st_ino returned in this function's callback is the st_ino
    from the hashed subvolume(assigned in dht_mkdir_hashed_cbk).

    distribute: Respect end-of-dir on readdir only for last subvol
    
    We need to ensure that only the last subvolume's end-of-directory
    notification is respected so that directory reading does not stop
    before all subvolumes have been read. That could happen because the
    posix for each subvolume sends a ENOENT on end-of-directory but in
    distribute we're not concerned only with a posix's view of the
    directory but the aggregated namespace' view of the directory,
    which is maintained by distribute.

    distribute: Return ino from the first-up subvolume in lookup
    
    Not returning this from the first-up subvolume results in
    
    different inode numbers being returned for a directory
    when the same directory is read again through the NFS
    readdir request.

    replicate: Restore parent ino from saved inode number
    
    Not doing this was resulting in a 0 inode number being returned
    in postparent on lookup, which in turn results in a ESTALE at
    the NFS client since an inode number change was observed.

    end-of-stream on the directory fd_t.

    cluster/afr: Failover readdir calls.
    
    This patch makes the replicate readdir call fail over to the next
    subvolume if the first call fails. It takes care to ensure that
    entries are not duplicated.
    
    The failover behavior of readdir only comes into effect if
    the option 'strict-readdir' is on.

    performance/write-behind: fix data corruption while aggregating the adjacent contiguous iobufs into a single iobuf
    
    - while aggregating, we should make sure that the destination has enough
       memory. __wb_collapse_write_bufs assumed that destination vector's iov_base
       was aligned to the start of an iobuf and hence memory of page_size is
       available for aggregation. This assumption is not always true, like in the
       configuration consisting afr->write->io-cache (afr is on top). Refer to the
       bug url for more details.

    io-threads: single queue/multi-thread model
    
    This patch lets io-threads work with a single queue and multiple
    threads work on picking the next request from the queue and process
    it.
    
    Whenever the number of pending requests in the queue double, a new
    worker thread is spawned.
    
    Workers expire after a (configurable) timeout of inactivity

    dht: Remove pointer casting in layout handling
    
    Small changes by Anand Avati <avati@gluster.com> over original submission:
    
    Remove pointer casting (copy data to proper memory before using it). Fixes bug #493.
    Hello,
    
    See bug #493 for more information on this patch.
    
    http://bugs.gluster.com/cgi-bin/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=493#c2
    
    This patch assumes that the scope of disk_layout is local wherever it is
    used. Seems correct, not really checked, though.

    introduced a terrible error. I overlooked the error checking in the

    storage/posix: Fix device number handling.
    
    There are two fixes in this patch:
    
    1) If the device number has changed, do a fresh stat on the export
       directory and if it matches the device number of the file,
       assume a remount happened and remember the new device number
       as official (this helps automounted export volumes).
    
    2) Don't log the "device number changed" message if it is due
       to a stat on ".." (in posix_readdirp), as it could be because
       ".." leads us out of the exported volume.

    Server backend storage hang should not cause the mount point to hang.
    
    Submitted-by: Krishna Srinivas <krishna@gluster.com>
    NOTE: fixed compilation issues in posix.c introduced while merging
    
    storage/posix polls for FS/kernel being functional by issuing
    statvfs() call. In case statvfs expires the timer, storage/posix will
    send CHILD_DOWN to upper translator. Ultimately this will cause
    protocol/server to disconnect all clients connected and also cleans up
    the data structures. Hence if soft lockup or other kernel bug causes
    backend FS to hang, the clients will not be hung.

    cluster/unify: don't call xl_init_tree on namespace node.
    
    - just before xl_init_tree call on namespace, unify node is set as parent of
        namespace node and since xl->ready of unify node is set only after return
        from init call, calling xl_init_tree on namespace node will result in
        execution of init of unify node for the second time. This results in
        following bugs:
    
        * since during second execution, parent of namespace node is unify, init of
          unify xlator fails.
        * even if init did not fail, re-execution of init in itself is bad, since it
          results in memory leaks etc. Worse, it can result in infinite recursive
          calls into init of unify node.

    More robust dictionary (un)serialization (fixes bug #397).
    
    Hello,
    
    This patch fixes bug 397: dictionary (de)serialization used pointer
    casting which forced word-alignment on (at least) armv5tel, causing
    corruption while writing and reading buffers into memory. It also adds
    some debugging (more information in case of errors).
    
    I tried to send this a few times already but I think it got bounced from
    the list.

    This commit is found to trigger spurious self heal by causing flush and writev to get
    reordered. Reverting as a workaround.

    fuse-bridge: make use of lock owner data in a protocol adherent way.
    
    No need for pid fallback, for those cases where we use it,
    it's always available.
    
    It appears conditionally in read/write/truncate (related to mandatory
    locking). There just get it for demonstrative purposes.
    
    Discard it from release, there locking data exists only as a
    portability hack, no use of it on Linux.

    resolver: handle resolutions of paths
    
    support a new type of resolution where only the path is sent from the
    client over the wire without inode/parent/generation numbers. this can
    happen when cluster translators could not look up inodes on a server
    and later when the server comes up applications issues operations on
    the inode without a lookup (since they could be cd'ed inside). In these
    cases the server makes the best attempt to resolve the path and perform
    the fop on it

    features/locks: Implement release xlator callback.
    
    This patch solves the lock bailout problem seen recently when autoconf tools were run. This is a workaround,
    where 'flock' locks are removed in pl_release, if an explicit UNLCK call does not come. The complete fix would
    be to allow 'fcntl' and 'flock' locks to operate in different domains.

    performance/stat-prefetch: don't check whether previous lookups have been failed in sp_process_inode_ctx.
    
    We need this patch for following reasons:
       1. The inode used in the successful lookup call may not be the one passed to
          fops operating on path. This may happen, if revalidate of inode is failed,
          but the lookup itself succeeds (in case of reavalidate failures, fuse
          sends a fresh lookup using new inode) and since inode_link, if there is an
          inode already associated with a path retains it.
       2. Only fops that "wait" in stat-prefetch for a lookup which is already in
          progress, need to check for the result of the lookup they are waiting on,
          before resuming and sp_process_inode_ctx is _not_ used in such contexts.

    mount/fuse: Refactored fuse_setattr.
    
    If both truncate & setattr need to be sent from fuse_setattr,
    they are now sent one after the other (setattr first, and then truncate)
    instead of being sent parallelly. The earlier code that sent them parallelly
    had a couple of problems:
    
    1) A bug in the logic that would sometimes cause the setattr call
       to never return, making the application hang.
    
    2) A possibility that truncate and setattr would race at the server/io-threads/posix
       end, thus returning the wrong stat structure to the application.
    
    This patch also removes an unneccessary "can_fuse_return" call in
    fuse_attr_cbk, which would cause a call to hang if STAT or FSTAT failed.

    libglusterfsclient: Separate order of path compaction and VMP search for abs and rel paths
    
    The previous set of changes for relative paths in libglusterfsclient
    break the absolute path operation. The fix involves differentiating
    between absolute and relative paths in terms of the order
    in which the 2 operations are performed:
    
    - path compaction
    - VMP search
    
    For absolute paths, since we assume that VMP is already perfixed to the
    path, we need the following order of operation:
    
    1. VMP search
    2. path compaction on the path components beyond the VMP.
    
    For relative paths, the operations are reversed because there
    we do not have a VMP pre-fixed in order to perform a VMP search.
    This means that a path compaction combined with prepending of the
    CWD is needed to get an absolute path before the VMP is searched for.

    storage/posix: Added janitor thread.
    
    The janitor thread deletes all files and directories in
    the "/" GF_REPLICATE_TRASH_DIR directory. This directory
    is used by replicate self-heal to dump files and
    directories it deletes.
    
    This is needed because letting replicate walk the directory
    tree and delete a directory and all its children is too racy.
    Instead, replicate self-heal only does an atomic rename(),
    and the janitor thread takes care of actually deleting them.

      won't be kept in trash. Eg:
          option eliminate-pattern *.out|*~
    * option to give 'maximum' file size to keep in trash, ie, when a
      20GB file is deleted, it won't be kept in trash if max file size
      given is 1GB. Eg:

    - If current lookup (2) does not wait for completion of the lookup (1) which
        is in progress, there can be a race condition where (2) completes ahead of
        (1) and resuming all the waiting operations in the queue. When (1) returns,
        the original operation (eg., stat, chmod etc) might've already unwound and
        hence the frame would've been destroyed.

    cluster/afr: Refactored lookup_cbk and introduce precedence of errors.
    
    Error handling in afr_lookup_cbk was faulty because it
    did not give priority to errors such as ESTALE over ENOENT,
    and ENOENT over other errors. This patch fixes that, and
    also breaks up afr_lookup_cbk into multiple logical functions.

    Changes in libglusterfs/rbthash:

    performance/stat-prefetch: remove lock member in sp_fd_ctx_t.
    
    - since the lifetime of fd context can be no longer than the fd, we can use
        lock in fd.

    performance/stat-prefetch: don't free the cache in readdir if the offset is not the expected one.
    
    - cache creation is expensive operation. Also, cache will be freed in
        releasedir. Hence, just remove all entries from cache without freeing
        the cache. However this is not entirely true, since sp_cache_remove_entry
        frees the old table and reinitializes a new table if all entries are being
        removed. When rbtree based hash table provides an interface to remove all
        the entries, sp_cache_remove_entry should be modified not to destroy the
        table.
    
      - this patch also fixes a race condition wherein the cache being used in
        lookup getting freed in readdir if the offset is not equal to expected
        offset.

    cluster/afr: Do self-heal on reopened fds.
    
    This patch brings in partial support for self-heal of open
    fds. The precondition is that the fd should have been opened
    successfully during the initial open() (or create()), and we
    assume that protocol/client has successfully reopened the fd
    when the subvolume comes back up.
    
    It works by doing an "up/down flush" (a dummy flush transaction
    to do post-op wherever necessary) and then triggering
    data self-heal on the file in the post-post-op hook of the
    dummy flush transaction. This ensures that any writes
    that come in during self-heal will wait until self-heal completes.
    
    The up/down flush is also done when a subvolume goes down,
    so that post-op is done on all subvolumes where pre-op was done.

    ping-timeout value need to configure it explicitly.

    libglusterfsclient: don't change the st_dev in stat-structure before doing inode_link.
    
    - st_dev is used for storing generation number of the inode in
        inode_link and libgf_iattr_transform changes the st_dev to fake_fsid.
        If inode_link is done after libgf_iattr_transform, the generation number
        stored will be wrong and will result in ESTALE errors from server.

    libglusterfsclient: fix memory leak.
    
    - glusterfs_glh_getxattr was implemented using libgf_client_lookup. Hence the
        inode corresponding to the path on which getxattr was done was refed twice
        - one during path_lookup and the other in libgf_client_lookup - but unrefed
        only once.
      - with inode generation number changes the inode returned by inode_link may
        not be the same as the input argument. Hence the inode returned by
        inode_link should be used, not the one returned in libgf_client_lookup_cbk.

    transport/ib-verbs: fix race-condition resulting in freeing of transport while it was still being used.
    
    - while handling a failed work completion status, the transport is
        disconnected. But further down in the code, the transport is still
        used. There can be a possibility that transport might've been freed
        by the time control reaches this point. More detailed description of
        events leading to this situation can be found at

           but in ib_verbs_receive it has not still read the data.
        3. thr 1 receives work completion event for another work request and
           overwrites the buffer pointer.

    fixes in stripe
    
    * fix in stripe readv, so that a read request which falls in
      two (or more) subvolumes, depending on stripe-size works fine.
    * fix in stripe_setattr_cbk, where 'postop' stat structure was
      returning wrong 'st_size'.

commit 26fbaa23cafee4643b7604660762656c4a71684b
Author: Vikas Gorur <vikas@gluster.com>
Date:   Thu Nov 12 08:44:16 2009 +0000

    cluster/afr: Ensure directory contents are in sync during opendir.
    
    The problem: If some files on the first subvolume disappeared
    without leaving a trace in the entry changelog (this can happen,
    for example, when an fsck has deleted files or when a hard drive
    is replaced), those files would never be self-healed even though
    they would be present on the second subvolume. This is because
    readdir is sent only to the first subvolume, and since the files
    don't appear in the directory listing, no lookup would ever be
    sent on them.
    
    This patch fixes this problem by doing a readdir on all the subvolumes
    during the first opendir on a directory inode. If a discrepancy in the
    contents is detected, entry self-heal in a special "force merge" mode
    is triggered on that directory.

        adresses belonging to the address-family specified, listen at 0.0.0.0/::0.
    
      - this patch is necessary since with AI_ADDRCONFIG, getaddrinfo fails if there
        are no active interfaces for the address family specified and when
        listen-host is specified we still want the functionality provided with
        usage of AI_ADDRCONFIG.

    lock-count was being set without checking for op_ret from lookup. This would
    cause a lot of Critical messages in the log as dict would be NULL in case
    of a lookup failure.
    
    Also, removed some trailing white spaces and did some minor re-factoring.

    If entry self-heal determines that a file/directory should
    be deleted from a subvolume, move that entry to a directory
    called "/.trash" on that subvolume. This is for two reasons:
    
    1) It limits the damage that can be done by a "wrong" entry
       self-heal.
    
    2) It solves the problem of a to-be-deleted directory not

    performance/io-cache: change the hash function used for rbtree based hash table.
    
    - the earlier hash function does not distribute pages uniformly for offsets that
        fit into 32 bits. The reason is that the hash function just xors the contents of
        the key 4 bytes at a time with the current value of hash. Hence for keys that
        fit into 32 bits, the hash will be the key itself. Since we are using the
        rounded_offset (which is a multiple of 128KB) as the key, the key will
        be exactly divisible by the number of buckets configured (4096) resolving all
        the pages into the first bucket.

    performance/io-cache: fix double free.
    
    - the destroyer function passed to rbthash_table_init is used to free the data.
        The data being inserted is page and it is destroyed in ioc_page_destroy. Hence
        no destroyer function needs to be passed to rbthash_table_init.

    cluster/afr: entry self-heal: Set parent directory's attributes using a new frame.
    
    There was a race condition in assuming that afr_sh_entry_impunge_parent_setattr_cbk will
       always return before impunge_xattrop_cbk and impunge_setattr_cbk.
    
       This patch fixes two additional problems:
    
    1) Building the parent_loc from impunge_local->loc after STACK_WIND to
       impunge_xattrop_cbk has happened. In a simple afr-posix configuration
       the stack will have been destroyed by the time building of parent_loc is
       attempted.
    
    2) parent_loc built in impunge_newfile_cbk was not being loc_wipe'd.

commit 492993570bb02bd7d244693ad28e409973fa9f4c
Author: Raghavendra G <raghavendra@gluster.com>
Date:   Tue Oct 20 03:43:43 2009 +0000

    performance/write-behind: fix to bug in setattr which was causing frames to be missed.
    
    - local->file was being assigned even before file pointer was got from any of
        the fds opened on the inode, thus making local->file to be NULL. In
        wb_setattr_cbk, since local->file is NULL (and hence file passed to
        wb_process_queue), wb_process_queue does not resume the pending operations
        queued for the file.

    replicate: fix missing frame in entry-self-heal
    
    when files on all backend nodes are missing, the logic in afr_sh_entry_erase_pending
    is broken and results in missing lookup frame. this causes processes to enter into

    posix: Ensure ENOTEMPTY return on rmdir
    
    Since we added an extra step after rmdir, i.e.
    the lstat on parent dir as part of the NFS-friendly
    changes, the successful return from postparent lstat
    clobbers the -1 error return from rmdir.
    
    This prevents this particularly ENOTEMPTY error from
    being propagated to higher translators.

    performance/stat-prefetch: implement procedure sp_process_inode_ctx.
    
    - this procedure processes inode_ctx to make decisions like whether the
        current procedure can continue (i.e., inode is already looked up),
        or the procedure has to initiate/wait for lookup on the path. It also
        sets up the frame->local and adds the stub corresponding to current fop
        if needed.

    performance/stat-prefetch: Add support code to implement lookup-behind.
    
    - change sp_lookup and sp_lookup_cbk to support sending lookups when needed.
        lookups might need to be sent in fops like open, chmod, chown etc which
        operate on a path, since the actual lookup sent to stat-prefetch by its
        parent xlators is not propagated down the xlator tree if the path is
        cached.

    performance/stat-prefetch: remove lookup-behind in sp_lookup.
    
    - lookup-behind should be done on-demand basis, in fops like open
        instead of in sp_lookup itself. This would reduce network traffic
        between client and server related to lookup, if the only use of
        lookup was to fetch stat structure.

    performance/stat-prefetch: optimizations to sp_lookup.
    
    - if stat cache cannot be found for a path in its parent inode and the path
        is a directory, we can get the cache from the inode corresponding to path
        and look for "." in that cache.

    performance/stat-prefetch: change behaviour of sp_lookup when xattr_req is not NULL.
    
    - if the xattr_req is empty (fuse just creates an empty dictionary and
        sends along lookup) we can still use the cache prefetched during readdir,
        since we need not fill the reply dictionary.

    performance/stat-prefetch: fix memory leaks
    
    - sp_cache_get_inode uses fd_lookup which internally increases the refcount of
        fd by 1. This needs to be unrefed once we get the cache.
      - for directories, stat is stored in the inode context in sp_lookup_cbk.
        but, while doing so, no check was being done for the presence of context
        in inode, resulting in leak of memory equal to sizeof (struct stat) when
        multiple lookups happened on the directory.
      - path constructed in sp_readdir was not freed.

    libglusterfs: Add STACK_UNWIND_STRICT macro.
    
    STACK_UNWIND_STRICT (op, frame, this, op_ret, op_errno, ...)
    
    The "op" argument is the name of the fop (lookup, open, etc.).
    This macro makes sure that the number and type of arguments
    passed match those of the callback function for the fop.

    cluster/afr: dir-write: Fix inode number handling.
    
    create, mkdir, symlink, mknod: Prefer to return itransform'd inode number
    from the first_up_child. If not, fall back on any other child that returned
    succcess.
    
    link, rename: Return the same inode number that
    was passed as part of loc_t.
    
    Also adds a new member to afr_local_t, local->first_up_child
    which is initialized at the start of the transaction. This
    fixes the race where a subvolume might go down during the transaction
    and thus have the first_up_child change.

    libglusterfsclient: don't destroy the iobuf pool during fini.
    
    - some of the iobufs in pool will be cached by io-cache and hence refcount

    This patch cleans up the umount and fini paths in preparation
    to support waiting for unwind of all pending call frames.
    
    Two misc fixes are:
    1. Fix to avoid deadlock in _libgf_umount by
    using _libgf_vmp_search_entry instead of
    libgf_vmp_search_exact_entry since the latter tries to take a
    lock already help by _libgf_umount.
    
    2. Avoid a crash in _libgf_umount by deleting the vmp
    entry from the list before it gets freed.

        stack-wound but reply is yet to come. The reason behind this option
        is to make use of the network, which is relatively free (with no writes
        or replies in transit). However, with non-standard block-sizes of writes
        the performance can actually degrade. Hence making this configurable.

    performance/write-behind: reduce traversal of request list during wb_mark_winds.
    
    - move all the decision making code to __wb_can_wind.
      - don't continue traversing the request list, once we know any of the
        following conditions are true:
        * requests other than write are present in queue.
        * writes are happening at non-contiguous offsets.
        * there are no write requests, which are wound to server but not yet
          received the reply.
        * enough data is aggregated for writing.

    - remove wb_mark_wind_aggregegate_size_aware, since wb_mark_wind_all does
        the same work (with check for whether current aggregated data size is

        wb_mark_wind_aggregate_size_aware called __wb_get_aggregate_size
        redundantly, thereby reducing the performance, since for small

    client-protocol: fix race-condition encountered while accessing fdctx
    
    - In protocol/client, fdctx is accessed by two sets of procedures,
      protocol_client_mark_fd_bad falls in one set whereas the other set consists of
      all fops which receive fd as an argument. The way these fdctxs are got is
      different in these two sets. While in the former set, fdctx is accessed
      through conf->saved_fds, which is a list of fdctxs of fds representing
      opened/created files. In the latter set, fdctxs are got directly from fd
      through fd_ctx_get(). Now there can be race conditions between two threads
      executing one procedure from these two sets. As an example let us consider
      following scenario:
    
      A flush operation is timed out and polling thread executing
      protocol_client_mark_fd_bad, fuse thread executing client_release. This can
      happen because, immediately a reply for flush is written to fuse, a release on
      the same fd can be sent to glusterfs and the polling thread still might be
      doing cleanup. Consider following set of events:
    
      1. fuse thread does fd_ctx_get (fd).
      2. polling thread gets the same fdctx but through conf->saved_fds.
      3. Now both threads go ahead and does list_del (fdctx) and eventually free
         fdctx.
    
      In other situations the same set events might occur and the threads
      executing fops other than flush in the second set might be accessing a
      fdctx freed in protocol_client_mark_fd_bad.

    booster: use __REDIRECT macro to prevent creat being renamed to creat64.
    
    - nm on libglusterfs-booster.so shows only creat64 defined but not creat. This
       behavior is observed due to following reasons.
    
       1. Booster is compiled with _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64.
       2. fcntl.h when included with _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 defined, renames all
       occurences of creat to creat64 in the source code from the point of
       #include <fcntl.h>.
    
       fcntl.h should be included since booster.c uses many of the macros defined in
       that header and glusterfs (booster in turn) has to be compiled with
       _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 since glusterfs uses datatypes (off_t, stat etc) whose
       sizes vary depending on whether this macro is defined or not. Basically, this
       macro should be defined to provide portability across 32 and 64 bit
       architectures.
    
       The correct fix is to make glusterfs to use datatypes big enough to hold 64 bit
       variants as well as 32 bit variants (like int64_t replacing off_t) and not to
       define _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 at all.
    
       As a temporary work around,
       1. we can implement creat functionality in a function with different name, say
       booster_false_creat
       2. rename this function to creat using __REDIRECT macro. since this renaming
       happens after renaming of creat to creat64 (from the first __REDIRECT macro
       in fcntl.h), we will end up with creat symbol being defined in
       libglusterfs-booster.so

    2.0.6 patch for io-cache pattern-matched non-caching
    
    Hello all,
    
    here is a small feature patch. Its intention is to give the user more control
    over the files performance/io-cache really caches. If the user knows exactly
    which files should be cached and which shouldn't there is currently no way to
    tell glusterfs _not_ to cache certain pattern. This patch allows you to
    disable caching by setting the priority of a pattern to "0". If you do not
    give any priority option it works just like before and caches everything.
    Honestly I am not totally sure that disabling caching works the way we did it,
    please comment.

    extras: Add LD_PRELOAD test tool
    
    This tool allows us to check the sanity of the LD_PRELOAD
    mechanism so that we can be sure that an application's syscalls
    will be redirected into booster when that library is LD_PRELOADed.
    
    In case of failed syscalls, this tool should be run first
    to see if the calls are redirected as required.

    storage/posix: handle dentries from different mount points in readdir
    
    - If posix translator is configured to have export directories to span accross
        different mount points, inode number is transformed in the dentry returned.
        Otherwise, the entry is not added to list of entries returned in readdir
        callback.
      - storage/posix returns ENOENT if the file is on different mount point other
        than that of exported directory and is not configured for export directory
        spanning across multiple mountpoints during lookup. But, since stat-prefetch
        shortcuts lookup calls, its necessary that readdir return only valid
        dentries.

    performance/stat-prefetch: flush stat corresponding to directory being read in readdir
    
    - delete the entry corresponding to basename of path on which fd is opened
       from cache stored in parent. This is necessary because readdir changes
       st_atime.

        2. inode corresponding to dirname of path on which fd is opened. This
           is necessary to get cache where entry corresponding to file on which
           fd is opened.

    rewriting stat-prefetch translator
    
    - stat-prefetch aims to optimize operations like 'ls -l' where a readdir
       is immediately followed by stat calls on each of the directory entry read.

    libglusterfsclient: Compare compcount with path not maxentry
    
    When searching for an exact entry we need to compare the
    component counts in the candidate VMP and the count in the
    path being searched. This is opposite to the current
    situation where we compare the component count in VMP
    and the component count in maxentry, which will always
    be same.

    Another attempt to enhance searching for VMP entries.
    There was a problem of returning the longest prefix match
    from all the VMPs without checking whether the number of
    matched components were same as the number of components
    in the candidate VMP.

    As of now, if a frame submit fails on server, there are no logs,

    libglusterfsclient: Sync access to VMP list on new entry addition
    
    Some weeks back, I'd separated the big lock into vmplock and mountlock.
    See commit 304e4274ca9b0339539581c5413e3339078c1182 in mainline.
    
    At that time, we did not have a solution to the problem
    of when to init the vmplist in a thread-safe manner, since
    there was no lock to protect the vmplock specifically, and that
    when libgf_vmp_map_ghandle was called inside glusterfs_mount
    so the "lock" was already being held.
    
    Now that we have separate mount and vmp locks, the
    accesses can be synced correctly.

    protocol/client: fixed registration of saved_fds
    
    In client_open_cbk, client_opendir_cbk the list_add_tail macros were invoked with wrong
    ordered arguments, causing the existing registered fd list to get unlinked from the
    saved_fds list. The effects of this is far fetched - when transport disconnects, open
    fds are no more marked bad as they are not reachable from the saved_fds list. After
    reconnection, resumed access on this fd causes reference to invalid fds on the server.
    It could appear in the form of 'unresolved fd' error, readdir happening on a file fd,
    files reading from other files, etc.

    When an fd_t is fd_create'd, we need to call fd_bind on it to
    ensure that any fd_lookup on the inode gets us this fd. We're not
    doing this so translators like write-behind were not able to order
    path-based requests at all resulting in some fops like stat, which
    could be issued after a writev, overtaking a previous writev which
    is still being written-behind.

    libglusterfsclient: Use iobufs for storing application write data
    
    Till now we've been creating an iovec, storing references in it
    to the application data and simply passing it on to the translator
    tree. This means that the buffer being passed to the translators is
    not at all associated with the memory ref'd by the iobref argument
    to write fop. This is a problem when write-behind is a translator in
    the tree since it assumes that the memory in the iovecs passed to
    write fops is already refcounted by the iobref and so it simply copies
    the address of the application data. The problem is that the application
    can continue using this buffer, free it or over-write it destroying the
    data that write-behind may write at a later time.
    
    The solution involves copying the application's write buffer into
    an iobuf which will be referred to by the iobref.

    glusterfsd: handle logfile path specification appropriately.
    
    when logfile path is not specified as absolute path, the symbolic
    link created to the logfile (only in invocation of glusterfs with
    --run-id) might end up as a broken symbolic link.
    
    for example, command-line invocation like below will result in
    broken symbolic link:
    glusterfsd -f /home/glusterfs/volfiles/nufa/nufa.vol
    -l ../home/glusterfs/logs/nufa.f1.log --run-id nufatest /mnt/nufa/
    
    symbolic link will be created at $PWD/../home/glusterfs/logs/nufa.f1.log
    will have a value of ../home/glusterfs/logs/nufa.f1.log.<date>.<time>.<pid>.
    this symlink might be broken.

    libglusterfsclient: Avoid overwrite of inode found through ino number
    
    In libgf_client_loc_fill, there is a possibility that all
    the ino, par and name are specified as non-NULL,non-zero args.
    
    So if an inode is located in the itable using the ino and the
    subsequent search for the inode using the par-ino and the file
    name does not result in an inode being found, the current
    code over-writes the inode that was found through the ino. The
    correct behaviour is to stop further searches if inode
    was already found using ino.

    Implementing quick-read translator.
    
    lookup can fetch the entire file in xattr dictionary using the key
    "glusterfs.content". We set the maximum size of the file that can
    be fetched so in the xattr_req dictionary using the same key. If file-size
    is less than or equal to the value set in dictionary, the content is stored
    in the dictionary using same key in lookup_cbk.
    
    For small files, we can do an optimization wherein we do not really send the
    calls open, read and close to the storage translators. Instead there can be
    an xlator which fakes open, read and close calls. For reads, it sends the data
    it has cached during lookup and hence saving the time for open, read and close
    calls to reach storage translators (this time can be significant if calls have
    to go through network to reach storage translator).

    ib-verbs: don't append ioq_entry to pending_list if first attempt of writing to network fails
    
    * fix to bug #101 - When a buffer bigger than ib-verbs-work-request-send-size
        was attempted to write to network, ib-verbs returns ENOTCONN. Neverthless,
        the ioq_entry corresponding to the write was appended to the pending lists
        of ioq_entries waiting to be written to network. This resulted in double
        free of header, once in protocol_client_xfer and again during cleanup of
        transport. The transport cleanup happened due to the timeouts of
        subsequent operations, since ioq_entry corresponding to writev
        was blocking any other operations from reaching server.

    cleanup client_forget
    
    upon detailed inspection of 'forget' behavior, it became evident that
    forgets from client should not goto server side, as server keeps its
    own purging mechanism to forget its inodes.
    
    if client sends all forget to server, many highly used required inodes
    may get freed up (it will surely effect io-cache buffers on server side)

    cluster/afr - use different dictionaries for sending xattrop requests to each of the subvolume
    
    - This patch fixes bug #29.
      - Using separate copies of dictionaries also eliminates a potential bug in a
        setup consisting of afr with a posix and client, each having io-threads on
        top as children. Since posix_xattrop after performing required operations
        on the xattr array passed in dictionary, sets the result at the same key
        and in the same dictionary passed as input argument,
        there can be race conditions where in the results of the operation on
        posix-child can be sent to the other child as input argument for xattrop,
        which ofcourse is wrong.

    booster: Fix build problems with various libtool versions
    
    We've been facing a problem on some test systems where the
    booster.so is built by libtool as an executable rather than
    a dynamically loadable library.
    
    This problem is probably caused by it seeing a _init function in
    the source. This is the name of the libc initiliazation
    function so it could be the source of the problem.
    
    In any case, ld-preloadable libraries must not have a function
    called _init, instead they need to have __attribute ((constructor))
    as the attribute for any and all functions the library wants
    executed before the program's main(). Our earlier approach was
    inherently problematic.
    This commit also cleans up the booster Makefile for better
    build behaviour. Credit: Harsha.

    libglusterfsclient: Fix glusterfs_mount-vmp search deadlock
    
    It is possible that the only translator in the libglusterfsclient
    tree is the posix. In that case, inside gluster_init, the graph
    init routines will need to call lstat on the posix subdirectory.
    
    Since even the glusterfs stack is running over booster, those
    calls will also first require vmp searching. BUT, the vmp lock
    is the same as the mount lock that was already taken when we entered
    glusterfs_mount, so a deadlock occurs.

    booster: Another attempt to fix 32 and 64 bit interoperability
    
    With this patch, we might have finally arrived at a solution
    to the problem of function definition conflicts between
    our functions and those of libc while over-riding the libc versions.
    
    This commit defines functions which do not conflict with libc,
    then it uses libc's own macro to redirect/rename these functions
    to the actual sys call names in the binary.

    This fix is needed in ha_statfs(), as the current code doesn't handle

    [Remember its stateless call]. This was causing 100% disk full logs in

    libglusterfsclient: Call inode_lookup to prevent pruning
    
    This bug shows up while using unfs3 with replicate. The absence
    of an inode_lookup on a looked-up/created inode results in it
    getting pruned from the inode table. Consequently, a subsequent
    lookup for the inode results in a different inode number being
    returned by replicate. This breaks unfs3 because it tries to remember
    the inode numbers returned by two different stat-family calls.

    booster: remove mount table which maps a path to glusterfs handler.
    
    - if there are any glusterfs mounts(real, not virtual) which are not specified
        through booster-fstab those mounts are also added to the virtual mountpoint
        list of libglusterfsclient. This also removes the mount table in booster and
        all the mounts whether they are real or virtual are handled by
        libglusterfsclient.

    io-threads: Fix missed notification in sem_timedwait
    
    We're performing a calculation for skewing idle time
    that resulted in a timespec.tv_nsec value becoming larger than
    1000 million or less than 0, forcing sem_timedwait to return
    with an EINVAL instead of waiting for a request notification
    from sem_post in iot_notify_worker(). This resulted in a missed
    notification that resulted in a hang followed by a timeout
    on the protocol/client side.
    
    This commit avoids the over- and under-flow in tv_nsec by
    skewing the tv_sec value instead.

    io-cache: prevent frames from getting woken up while page is getting validated
    
    1. A page will be put on the inode waitq if the 'freshness' has to be verified with an fstat()
    
    2. while the fstat is in transit, other calls (like lookup) can update ioc_inode->tv, resetting the freshness (page still on inode waitq)
    
    3. Another read request on the same page, after the updated freshness, will wake up the page frames neglecting the fact that the page is also waiting on the inode (waiting for the fstat completion)
    
    4. once the page's frames are woken, the page becomes elegible for purging and can get destroyed for various reasons, leaving a destroyed page pointer in the inode's waitq
    
    5. fstat returns and hits the destroyed page pointer causing a crash
    
    The fix is to all together disable cache hits when any page of the same inode is under validation. The otherwise cache hit will now be subjected to the ongoing validation by getting queued to the inode waitq.

    unify getdents count reduced to 512 (from 1024)
    
    Thanks to Krishna <krishna (at) gluster.com> for pointing this out.
    
    When a unify self-heal of large directory (directory with lot of entries)
    is done, the getdents_cbk used to fail because of new limit of buffer size
    (128KB). Noticed that earlier it used to streach upto 4MB, hence the value
    1024 worked fine. By reducing it to 512, noticed, we can fit in well within
    128KB limit, and hence unify self-heal goes through.

    libglusterfsclient: Increase readdir block size
    
    This improves the potential for pre-fetching a larger
    number of dirents. Consider that, with 255 chars as the max
    name length for each dirent, in the worst case scenario, where
    we actually have files with such large names, we're not getting
    more than 4 entries with the current block size of 1024.
    
    Generally also, increasing the size to 4k provides us
    with a higher chance that directories with low to medium
    number of dirents will be pre-fetched in a single readdir fop.

    libglusterfsclient: Add dirent pre-fetching and caching
    
    The fop interface is such that we're able to extract more than
    1 dirent in a readdir fop. This commit now enables libglusterfsclient
    to read multiple entries on a glusterfs_readdir call. Once these
    have been pre-fetched, they're cached till either glusterfs_closedir
    ,glusterfs_rewinddir or glusterfs_seekdir are called.
    The current implementation is beneficial for sequential directory
    reading and probably indifferent to applications that do a lot of seekdir
    and rewinddir after opening the directory. This is because
    both these calls result in dirent cache invalidation.

    booster: Move fstab parsing into booster from libglusterfs
    
    This is another attempt at fixing build problems on Solaris.
    I am told that booster build is disabled on Solaris and I know
    that it is disabled on Mac OS X also. Getting it to work
    on both these systems is now on my TODO list, mainly
    because on both these systems, we can have a glusterfs client
    running without requiring FUSE.

    io-threads: Change mutexes/condvars to spinlocks/semaphores
    
    It seems that use of mutexes is resulting in pretty high thread
    sleep and wake-up cost. What is worse, if a worker thread has
    acquired a  lock, there is a possibility of the main glusterfs thread
    being put to sleep. We change the use of mutexes into spinlock.
    At the same time, we cannot anymore use condvars for notification since
    the condvar interface depends on mutexes itself. Semaphores come to
    out rescue. Luckily, even the pthread semaphores have a timedwait
    interface to allow our idle worker threads to make an exit decision.
    
    Further, it is possible that spinlocks are not available on all systems
    so all this is curtained behind #defines so we can fall back to
    mutexes and condvars implementation.

    io-threads: Support mem-pool allocator for iot_request_t
    
    This commit brings in support for allocation of iot_request_t's
    in io-threads through the use of the mem-pool. We're hoping
    that the overheads of hundreds and thousands of small allocations
    can be avoided through this.
    
    The important point to note is that the memory pool is not
    for the translator as a whole but there is one small memory
    pool for each worker thread. Not only does that help us
    avoid malloc overheads for small allocations like iot_request_t
    but also avoid contention on the heap data structures when multiple
    threads want an iot_request_t from the pool.

    mem-pool: Restructure mem-pool behaviour
    
    This commit changes mem-pool behaviour to return a directly usable
    address by performing the required adjustment on the address
    being returned.
    
    This is different from the previous behaviour where we're trying to fit
    into the requested size, the list_head*2 also. This is not efficient
    enough in terms of space but hopefully works better than not having any
    mem-pool at all. Besides, I am not comfortable with mem-pool meta-data
    and caller-useable memory area being the same because of the potential for
    mem-pool's data structure corruption.
    
    PS:
    Please do read the comments in the code for more info during review.

    libglusterfsclient: Wipe loc->ino in libgf_client_loc_wipe
    
    Not cleaning up the ino member of a loc_t results in SIGABRT
    in __inode_link because in some cases, the loc->ino is
    different from loc->inode->ino. This happens especially in code
    blocks which re-use a loc_t structure for pointing at different
    inodes/files. For eg, if a loc_t has been assigned an inode and
    an ino, and followed by a libgf_client_loc_wipe, then re-use of this
    loc in say libgf_client_lookup results the SIGABRT because
    libgf_client_lookup calls inode_link with the same loc_t. However,
    this loc_t has just been assigned a new inode pointer but the ino
    member still contains a previous inode's inode number. This difference
    in inode numbers results in an assertion failure, so the SIGABRT.

    libglusterfsclient: Revert and re-do readdir conformance
    
    This commit basically reverts the previous readdir conformance
    patch I sent a few days back. That commit had a completely retarded
    and broken way of maintaining per-directory dirent.
    
    It was broken for two reasons:
    1. Creating a wrapper structure around the directory's fd_t
    only for storing a struct dirent is not clean enough. This commit
    takes a better approach by storing the dirent in fd_t context.
    This dirent is valid only if the fd_t refers to a directory.
    
    2. That commit was made and tested under the assumption (..stupidity
    is a better word..) that only opendir call is used for opening a
    directory. That is not correct. Directories are also opened using the
    open syscall. The point is, glusterfs_open returns an fd_t and so did
    glusterfs_opendir. The previous patch actually changed opendir to
    return a new wrapper structure. That is fine, if we go by the POSIX
    definition of open and opendir because, they're both supposed to
    return different types, an int and a DIR*. However, in
    libglusterfsclient, all other code assumes that directory handles
    corresponding to DIR* and file descriptors corresponding to int types
    are the same type, resulting in use of the same locking and fd context
    addition/extraction code. So a directory opened using opendir returned
    a wrapper structure which went down into the libglusterfsclient stack
    where some function called a lock on the handle assuming it was an
    fd_t, since it is not and dereferencing of the supposed fd->inode->lock
    results in a seg fault.
    
    Obviously, this didnt show up till unfs3 used open() to open a
    directory and not opendir.

    default log file different per mount (or if server, per volumefile)
    
    This feature is required becuase when more than one glusterfs process
    is started with default log file, all logs will be going to same file,
    which after a while gets more confusing.

    booster: Add fstab parsing support
    
    This commit changes the booster.conf format from a
    simple custom format to that of the /etc/fstab.c
    
    See booster_mount(..) for the mount options supported/required
    for LD_PRELOADing booster. I'll write a small help doc soon.
    
    This commit also brings in fstab parsing code into libglusterfs
    because Darwin libc only supports reading the hardcoded /etc/fstab.

    transport shortcut b/w client and server
    
    This patch makes the server pass back the transport pointer of the client. If the UUID matches, the client makes the local transport 'shortcut' with the remote transport (pointer received from server)
    
    The shortcut simulates a socket queue. Instead of serialized messages going over the network and getting queued in the tcp socket queue, the messages get queued in a transport specific queue picked by a polling thread.

    libglusterfsclient: Improve readdir conformance on re-entrancy
    
    readdir is supposed to be non-re-entrant only with respect to the
    given dir stream, not the whole process.
    
    What that means is the static struct dirent that we maintain in
    libglusterfsclient should be per-directory handle and not
    process-wide.

    libglusterfsclient: Fix large directory reading bug
    
    As of now, we use 1024 bytes as the buffer for reading directory
    entries. If a directory as many files, then its possible that it does
    not fit into this buffer, thereby requiring more than one call to
    readdir. Now suppose the last bunch of directories fit more or less
    exactly int the 1024 byte buffer. If this happens, the offset
    extracted by the current logic(in libgf_client_readdir) never gets
    updated beyond the first entry in this last block, because the last
    block's first entry always remains same. This explanation is
    convoluted, I know, but I too found out the hard way.

    booster: Add VMP-based open support
    
    In brief, when an open is called the VMP-based open is called first.
    If that fails, the fallback is the Mount-Point Bypass(MBP) technique
    which uses entended attributes to determine if the given
    path is a gluster mount. If it is, it goes ahead to create a
    glusterfsclient handle. All subsequent calls to this real mount point
    get redirected to the glusterfsclient handle. The other fallback is
    the actual open syscall on the local file system itself. This happens
    when the absence of an extended attribute tells us that the path is
    not even a glusterfs mount point.

    We define the O_CREAT, etc. flags so that we can remove fcntl.h from the

    booster: Integrate VMP-based mounting
    
    This commit brings into booster the use of VMP based operations
    which will allow users of booster to specifiy a VMP and use it
    for transparently operating on a glusterfs client context.
    
    Since applications are oblivious to booster's presence, because it is
    LD_PRELOAD'ed, we need to specify the VMPs and the corresponding
    options like volfile, logfile, loglevel, through a conf file.
    
    By default, this conf file is the /etc/booster.conf. This can be
    over-ridden through the GLFS_BOOSTER_CONF environment variable
    for the application.
    
    The format of the conf file is very simple for now. Each VMP is
    described on a single line with space separated fields.
    
    Format: <Virtual Mount Point> <volfile-path> <log-file> <log-level>
    
    <log-level> takes the string representation of the usual glusterfs
    log levels.

    libglusterfsclient: Fix realpath operation
    
    This commit does two things:
    1. Ensures we go on to traverse nested symlinks by calling realpath
    recursively on the symlink.
    
    2. Makes glusterfs_realpath, a VMP-based operation, return a resolved
    /real path that actually has the VMP pre-fixed to the resolved path.
    If this is not done, we'll be returning a path that is valid only
    within the glusterfs context, i.e. the path will point to a real
    file/dir only if a glusterfs handle identifies which glusterfs context
    the file is in.

    libglusterfsclient: Guard against un-inited VMP searches
    
    On my system, an selinux module gets inited before
    booster even though the FS calls from the selinux module
    get routed through our LD_PRELOAD'ed wrappers. In this
    scenario, the VMP list is un-inited, resulting in a seg-fault
    if it is dereferenced. The list_empty check does not help
    because the pointers in the list have non-NULL values.

    io-threads: Clarify thread count range
    
    This patch cleans up io-threads behaviour regarding the
    range values that can be specified for min-threads
    and max-threads. THe major change is that the min threads
    have been reduced to 2 to signify that io-threads needs minimum
    two threads for its operation, while keeping the default number of
    threads at 16. The idea is to decouple the default thread count
    from the minimum thread count.

    This applies over Raghu's indentation and logging take-3 patch.

    fd leak fix
    
    steps:
      - server_finodelk uses req->volume pointer into state->volume
      - finodelk is queued by locks translator
      - c call returns from server_pollin and hdr is FREE'd
      - now state->volname is pointing to FREE'ed region (junk)
      - server_finodelk_cbk calls gf_add_locker
      - gf_add_locker remembers lock with junked path along with fd_ref
      - gf_del_locker from new server_finodelk cannot string match with junked volume thus
        lock is not deleted, hence fd_ref remains as a leak

    Initing op_errno to EINVAL ensures that this is the value
    that gets returned on STACK_UNWIND, in case any of the VALIDATE macros
    result in exit from "out" due to a NULL argument. If this is not done
    , we get op_ret as -1 with errno set to 0 in the application's
    syscall.

    libglusterfsclient: Fix stat cache bug
    
    The way stat cache gets updated was not consistent across
    all syscalls. Consequently, I was running into a bug that
    returned a 0 st_ino. The fix actually resides in the hunk
    that changes the lines in libgf_client_lookup but similar
    changes were also required in other users of stat cache.
    
    This commit fixes the bug and also cleans up the way stat
    cache is updated.

    libglusterfsclient: Add virtual mount point support
    
    One part of the glusterfsclient library requires users
    to use a handle to address a particular glusterfs context.
    This can become cumbersome for applications that need to use multiple
    such context. For such applications, we make it easy by letting them
    define virtual mount points(VMPs), which are just paths that identify
    a particular glusterfs context. This is done through a new
    glusterfs_mount(..) interface.
    
    Subsequenly, any path based operations, that pre-pend a VMP before
    the files and directories inside the glusterfsd export, get internally
    routed to the correct glusterfs context. This helps users do away
    with the need to maintain their own path-to-glusterfs_handle_t
    mapping.
    
    The old handle-based interface still exists for whoever wishes to use
    it.

    client_protocol_reconnect - do not send notify of CHILD_DOWN event if errno from transport_connect() was EINPROGRES
    
    This bug was racing between a CHILD_UP from poll thread resulting from the event_register() of the new socket called in fuse thread. CHILD_UP would sometimes overtake the CHILD_DOWN for EINPROGRESS. So replicate would receive CHILD_DOWN as the latest event. This resulted in self-heal not happening etc.

    libglusterfsclient: Abstract away inode attr cache updates
    
    This commit creates a separate function that allows users of
    the inode attribute cache to update the cache when required.
    Major users are lookup, stat and fstat functions.
    
    The function libgf_update_iattr_cache(..) allows updating the lookup
    and stat caches separately using flags.

    libglusterfsclient: Fix segfault on non-NULL loc->name
    
    The gf_log message actually assumes that loc->name will have a valid
    non-NULL name in it, whereas if the loc_t being passed to it was
    actually created on a function stack, i.e. a local function variable
    and was then passed down the code path to do_path_resolve without ever
    initing it or zeroing the structure, its possible that the name member
    has a non-NULL but corrupted address. This leads to a segfault.
    Whereas, we know loc->path will always have the full path.

    We must create the file based on the O_CREATE in the flags

    This works because we've already handled O_EXCL earlier and
    also handled a missing file(ENOENT)
    in case this was actually an open and not create.

    This special case is required for file creation because:
    1. We cannot depend on the previous lookup to have reliably looked up
    the parent inode.
    
    2. inode for the new file does not exist in the itable.

    libglusterfsclient: Resolve path on empty caches
    
    The earlier case was that the explicit lookups to the server
    were being sent only when the parent inode was NULL. This situation
    breaks when the parent inode is available in the i- or d-cache
    but the child dirent is not. In such a case, no explicit lookups
    were being sent to get the missing child dirent.
    
    Now, explicit path lookup happens even if the inode for parent or basename
    is not found in the caches.
    
    This also fixes a seg-fault occuring during glusterfs_open, in my test
    case, but one that could occur almost anywhere lookup code is used.

    libglusterfsclient: Fix segfault in glusterfs_open
    
    libgf_client_loc_fill gets passed a name=NULL argument.
    So when this function returns the filled loc argument, this loc
    is actually missing the inode structure that was to be filled.
    
    The segfault actually occurs a few lines later when
    we try to access fd->flags but fd returned by fd_create is NULL
    because we'd passed a NULL inode to it, i.e. the loc->inode.

    io-threads: Refactor ordered worker exit path
    
    This patch re-factors the exit path of an ordered worker
    on a time-out. Earlier we're checking for exit permission
    in such a way that required us to release and acquire
    the worker lock a second time in the worker loop opening
    a window wherein a new request could've been appended to the
    request queue.
    
    This patch makes the decision to exit while still holding on to the
    worker lock.

    io-threads: Support autoscaling volfile options
    
    This commit finally makes the autoscaling feature visible to the user.
    Know that we're now using two separate thread-pools, one for data
    requests, called ordered thread-pool in io-threads, and the other
    for meta-data requests, called un-ordered thread-pool.
    We do not expose this information to the user to keep io-threads
    simple. Consequently, when the user specifies a min-threads and
    max-threads value, the number of threads assigned to each pool
    is equal, i.e. both pools start with their min threads set to half of
    the option "min-threads" and both scale up their threads at most up to
    half of option "max-threads".
    
    Volfile options will be added to the wiki and user-guide.

    iot_schedule_unordered(..). The unordered thread-pool
    consists of thread running the iot_worker_unordered(..)
    function.
    
    b. Make threads in the un-ordered thread pool start-up
    and exit depending on the thread state.
    
    Note that at this point the requests that need
    ordering are still going through iot_schedule(..).

    io-threads: Classify requests for threadpool type
    
    New io-threads will serve requests through two separate
    threadpools.
    
    One thread pool for requests that must be ordered
    on a file that is open. so that the server can process the requests
    in the order they were entered in the requests queue, and not in the order
    the io-thread is able to send a request, which in turn is determined
    by how the thread gets scheduled. This can also be called the
    data-intensive ops thread pool.
    
    Second thread-pool for requests that dont care about ordering, i.e.
    requests like lookup, open, create, mkdir, etc.

    IO-threads Cleanup: Clean-up request scheduling and queueing interface.
    
    This patch does two things:
    
    1. Cleans up the request scheduling and queueing interface so that all
    fops only need to call iot_schedule and not iot_queue and in some
    cases iot_schedule.
    
    2. Till now, we've had open and create calls go through the main
    glusterfsd thread when sending open and create fops. This patch makes
    them also go through the worker threads. But since the open and
    creates requests would not be called with a valid inode number in the
    loc_t, these requests will get assigned to the worker at index 0.
    This will be fixed RSN, when we introduce various techniques of
    distributing the inodes(..not requests..) over the worker threads.

    IO-threads Cleanup: Change workers list to dynamically allocated array
    
    Worker threads were represented as a list in iot_conf_t
    which made us traverse the list of workers in order to
    decide which thread gets the request. Now we represent the
    workers as a dynamically allocated array so that we can just index
    into the array to schedule the file.
